He outlined plans to open 200 new Simply Food outlets. \nM&S refused to identify which 30 \u201cfull-line\u201d stores \u2013 which sell clothing, homewares and food \u2013 are to close or identify the 45 outlets that will be converted into food stores. The chain has 304 full-line stores and the closures and conversions will take five years to complete.\nThe retailer is also looking to relocate underperforming stores. Overall, the changes will mean a reduction of 10% in the floorspace devoted to racks of skirts, jumpers and trousers, with the plan expected to cost \u00a3150m over three years.\nThe turnaround plan outlined by Rowe also includes the closure of 53 loss-making overseas stores in 10 countries. They include 10 stores in China, seven in France and others in Belgium and Hungary, resulting in 2,100 job losses. Only company-owned stores in Ireland, Hong Kong and the Czech Republic will be spared.\nThe embattled retailer intends to put clothing and food on an equal footing with same amount of selling space devoted to both sides of the business. Currently two-thirds of its floor space is given over to racks of clothing and homewares. \nRowe, who began his retail career aged 15 as a Saturday boy at M&S\u2019s Croydon store in south London and took over as chief executive six months ago, insisted the decision to close stores and reduce the space given over to clothing was not an admission of defeat.\n\u201cThis is not about cutting jobs, it\u2019s about making sure we\u2019ve got the right estate for future shopping habits,\u201d he said. \nEarlier this year, he announced 500 job cuts at the group\u2019s head office in London and a plan to shift another 400 jobs out of the capital.\nThe M&S veteran is seeking to revive the fortunes of the 132-year-old retailer which has seen profits go backwards in recent years. His biggest job is stopping the rot in its clothing business which has now in its fifth consecutive year of falling sales. M&S believes the growth of online fashion shopping means it can devote more store space to food without losing sales. About 17% of M&S\u2019s clothing sales are currently made online, a figure that is expected to grow.\nRowe is also axing the chain\u2019s Indigo, Collezione and North Coast labels to focus on brands that are \u201cmost relevant to our customers\u201d including Autograph, Per Una and Blue Harbour.\n\u201cThese are tough decisions, but vital to building a future M&S that is simpler, more relevant, multichannel and focused on delivering sustainable returns,\u201d said Rowe.\nThe plan was not well received by investors; shares finished the day as the biggest faller in the FTSE 100 \u2013 down more than 5% as analysts complained that Rowe\u2019s plan to revive M&S was not radical enough. \u201cBeing such a large company, it is going to take some time to turn M&S round even if all goes according to plan,\u201d said Haitong analyst Tony Shiret. \u201cWe think that it should have gone further in its UK clothing space closure.\u201d\nM&S\u2019s decision to retreat from the high street will be a blow for some towns, where it is a main destination store, especially following the demise of BHS. But as more purchases are made online, stores in smaller or less attractive town centres and shopping centres are finding life difficult.\n\u201cThe closure of the local M&S will have a psychological effect and feel like another nail in the coffin for that town\u2019s high street,\u201d said Local Data Company analyst Matthew Hopkinson. Hopkinson points to places such as Swindon and Stockton-on-Tees where shoppers have been drawn away from the high street by out-of-town retail parks.\nM&S has been battered by low-cost rivals such as H&M, Zara and Primark and shoppers are increasingly spending their spare cash on leisure activities, rather than buying new clothes. The turnaround plan was unveiled as the retailer reported a 19% fall in underlying profits to \u00a3231m in the six months to 1 October.\nTo win back shoppers, Rowe has already cut clothing prices and promised to pay more attention to its most loyal group of shoppers \u2013 fiftysomething women he has dubbed \u201cMrs M&S\u201d. He said changes he had already made in the clothing business were going down well. \u201cThe initial feedback we\u2019ve had from customers has been good,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ve improved the fit on many garments and, for the first time in a number of years, we\u2019ve grown full-price market share.\u201d\nRowe has promised a less slavish pursuit of catwalk trends after being criticised for failing to meet the needs of its middle-aged customer base. \nHis new strategy is an about turn from that of his predecessor Marc Bolland, who believed the retailer could be a global brand and reopened stores in France after a decade-long absence.\n\u201cWe have made mistakes in the past and we are taking action to correct some of these,\u201d said Rowe, who revealed M&S would continue to expand overseas using a franchise model. The mistakes are expensive ones \u2013 it will cost up to \u00a3200m to shut loss-making stores in European markets such as France, Belgium and the Netherlands as well as outposts in China.\n\n\n\n\n"},

Hardline ministers who had criticised policies including privatisations were dumped for moderate technocrats in what was interpreted as a further shift to the centre by the man who once personified the hope of Europe\u2019s radical left. \n\u201cWe are very near the end of a long period of very difficult decisions,\u201d he told his newly assembled cabinet. Tsipras said reform negotiations had to be concluded by 5 December so that eurozone finance ministers, holding their last meeting this year, could begin debating how best to cut the country\u2019s debt. \nAt over \u20ac320bn (\u00a3285bn), Greece\u2019s debt pile is regarded as its biggest impediment to economic recovery. \nIn a move aimed at placating the lenders who have bailed out Greece three times since its economic near-collapse six years ago, the respected US-based economics professor Dimitri Papadimitriou was appointed economy minister. The 70-year-old head of the Levy Economics Institute, a thinktank, will have oversight of investment policies and EU structural funds.\nSignalling he would push ahead with the often unpopular policies demanded by Greece\u2019s lenders \u2013 the European Union and the International Monetary Fund \u2013 Tsipras also retained the finance minister, Euclid Tsakalotos. The Oxford-educated economics professor has won plaudits for his low-key efficacy, in sharp contrast to his forerunner, Yanis Varoufakis.\nStergios Pitsiorlas, a veteran leftist who helped found the ruling Syriza party, was elevated to the position of deputy economy minister. In his previous role as chairman of Greece\u2019s privatisation agency, Pitsiorlas had been praised for his no-nonsense approach to disposing of cash-draining state assets. The shipping minister, Theodoros Dritsas, who was against further investment in Piraeus port by the Chinese conglomerate Cosco was among those dropped, while Panos Skourletis, the energy and environment minister, who had vehemently opposed the partial privatisation of the Public Power Corporation, was moved to the interior ministry.\nSkourletis, an established Syriza figure, was described by insiders as too powerful to be removed altogether. He was replaced by George Stathakis who had held the economy ministry portfolio. \nThe septuagenarian leftist ideologue Aristides Baltas, who had been culture minister, was similarly replaced by Lydia Koniordou, Greece\u2019s foremost female classical actor. \nA new migration ministry was also established, reflecting the country\u2019s frontline role in the refugee crisis and allowing the deputy migration minister, Ioannis Mouzalas, to tap into resources and administrative backup in his promoted role as minister. \nThe popularity of Tsipras\u2019s two-party coalition has been in free-fall. A Public Issue poll last week put the government 24 percentage points behind the centre right New Democracy, the main opposition party. Tax increases and sustained cuts to wages and benefits have corroded its support with thousands of pensioners recently taking to the streets in protest in Athens.\nWith many of the measures beginning to bite this winter, the challenges remain immense for the country still seen as Europe\u2019s weakest link. Tsipras told his 48-member cabinet that by completing reforms Greece could \u201cfollow the roadmap\u201d of being included in the European Central Bank\u2019s quantitative easing programme early next year, which would see the bank acquire Greek government debt. The government is also aiming to regain access to debt markets by the time its latest bailout expires in 2018.\n"},

Linda Burnip, a founder of Disabled People Against Cuts (Dpac) said it \u201ccame as no surprise to anyone who has followed the stripping away of disabled people\u2019s rights over the last six years.\u201d\nThe UK government, however, rejected the UN report, saying in a formal response its findings presented an inaccurate picture of life for disabled people in the UK. \u201cWhile the government continues to improve and build on the support available to disabled people, it stands by and is proud of its record.\u201d\nThe report is withering about the manner in which ministers have conducted welfare and social care reforms, arguing that they pushed ahead with changes even when they knew they would have an adverse impact on disabled people.\nCuts such as those to personal independence payments and the independent living fund had \u201chindered various aspects of [disabled people\u2019s] right to live independently\u201d, it says, making them more reliant on family and carers and in some instances forcing them into institutional care.\nThe bedroom tax and other cuts to housing support had led disproportionately to debt and eviction, it says. \u201cEvidence indicates that persons with disabilities affected by cuts in their housing benefits have undergone high levels of stress anxiety and depression as a consequence of the shortfalls in their budget.\u201d\nIt is highly critical of what it calls the \u201cfunctional assessments\u201d of disabled people who have applied for social security benefits, noting that their experience tended to be one where they were \u201cmerely processed rather than being listened to or understood\u201d.\nGovernment attempts to decrease the disproportionately high levels of unemployment among disabled people have had little impact, the report notes, while notorious \u201cfit-for-work\u201d tests were riven with flaws.\nIt noted that disabled people had suffered from a climate in which they were portrayed as \u201clazy and putting a burden on taxpayers\u201d. They had continued to experience \u201cincreasing hostility, aggressive behaviour and sometimes attacks to their personal integrity\u201d.\nThe report, issued by the committee on the rights of persons with disabilities, concludes: \u201cThere is reliable evidence that the threshold of grave or systematic violations of the rights of persons with disabilities has been met.\u201d\nThe inquiry was triggered after campaigners, including Dpac, made a formal complaint to the UN in 2012 about alleged violations of disabled people\u2019s rights. After two years of deliberations, the UN committee on the rights of persons with disabilities gave the green light to the inquiry in May 2014.\nThe inquiry report is based on an 11-day inquiry tour of the UK undertaken by two UN envoys in October 2015. The inquiry team met with more than 200 individuals, including officials and MPs as well as activists and academics.\nThe UK has been a signatory to the UN convention on the rights of people with disabilities since 2007. The convention includes the right to live independently, to work and to enjoy social protection without discrimination on the basis of disability.\n"},

The FTSE 250, which includes more domestically focused companies, posted a smaller 1.8% weekly fall.\nThe last set of US labour market figures before Tuesday\u2019s election showed a slightly smaller increase in non-farm payrolls than the 175,000 rise Wall Street had been expecting.\nBut analysts said the improvement was solid enough to persuade the US central bank, the Federal Reserve, to raise interest rates at its next meeting in December. The Bureau of Labor Statistics revised up jobs growth for August and September by a combined 44,000 and said annual wages growth had edged up from 2.7% to 2.8% \u2013 a seven-year high.\n\u201cIt seems that the only remaining obstacle to the Fed hiking in December would be a significant adverse financial market reaction to the US presidential election,\u201d said Chris Williamson, chief business economist at the consultancy IHS Markit.\nSquabbling between Saudi Arabia and Iran has sent the oil price down, as tension between the near neighbours threatened to derail talks aimed at cutting production by the Opec group of oil-producing countries.\nRiyadh is reportedly threatening to turn the screw on Tehran before this month\u2019s crucial Opec meeting by increasing its own output to push prices even lower.\nSaudi Arabia produces up to 10.7m barrels per day (bpd) at the moment, but Opec sources said it had threatened to open the taps much further.\n\u201cThe Saudis have threatened to raise their production to 11m bpd and even 12m bpd, bringing oil prices down, and to withdraw from the meeting,\u201d one Opec source told Reuters.\nThe cost of a barrel of Brent crude dropped to $45.02 before recovering to $45.42, down 2%, after Opec\u2019s secretary general, Mohammed Barkindo, denied Saudi Arabia had made any threats.\n"},

You know: spending the next month tutting whenever you hear Christmas music while becoming increasingly excited that Christmas is coming.\nThis year is particularly exciting as, for the first time, my partner and I are not spending it with either of our families but are instead staying at home. I haven\u2019t quite decided what to make for pudding yet, but I decided to get in the spirit by having a first attempt at Delia\u2019s Irish whiskey Christmas cakes.\nThis is a recipe that requires something of a run-up. In order to get the flavours right, it must be stored in the fridge for seven days, where the mixture of whiskey, Angostura bitters, raisins, currants and almonds has to be given time to mature along with your growing irritation at the large box now taking up space in your fridge to house this delicious cake.\nAt least, that\u2019s the theory. I ran into a few problems with this recipe \u2013 not least that the first time around the lag between making a hash of the recipe, and then discovering this, made it difficult to remember what, exactly, I had done wrong. I advise taking notes on the first couple of run-throughs.\nDelia\u2019s recipe uses nutmeg, cinnamon and cloves. My advice is to buy the right amounts fresh to make this cake, unless you prefer the prospect of Stephen\u2019s Overwhelming Clove and Whiskey cake to Delia\u2019s mellower, authentic version.\nMy second difficulty came with the whiskey itself. I\u2019ve always wanted to persuade myself to like whiskey, as it always looks terribly sophisticated in movies, but I have yet to succeed \u2013 other than in cakes, where I like it a great deal.\nAs I didn\u2019t much fancy shelling out for a particularly high-quality bottle of the stuff, I went low-budget. (I\u2019m ashamed to admit that my preparation for this recipe consisted of googling \u201ccheap Irish whiskey\u201d and buying a bottle for a tenner.)\nI found that the resulting cake still tasted a little too strongly of whiskey \u2013 and cloves of course. It tasted like someone\u2019s mouth after an evening of cheap booze and mince pies \u2013 so if you\u2019ve ever had an ill-advised hookup at a Christmas party, and wanted to recreate the experience in cake form, I have an excellent recipe for you.\nMy advice is to slightly under-dose on the whiskey in Delia\u2019s recipe, who I imagine went for a rather better bottle than I did. That, or buy better whiskey.\nThe finished product is meant to look like an elegantly wrapped parcel, which \u2013 if you remove the word \u201celegantly\u201d \u2013 mine does.\nThe finished product a la Delia looks like the presents you buy that are gift-wrapped in-store. My finished product looks like a present wrapped by an enthusiastic child \u2013 very possibly a child who has been helping themselves to the whiskey.\nTo hold it all together, Delia uses marzipan as a joining agent. I am aware that marzipan is a divisive foodstuff \u2013 some people think it\u2019s disgusting \u2013 and I am happy to report that there are three ways around this.\nThe first is to make more of the apricot jam and whiskey mixture and use that to hold it together. The second is to use regular icing.\nThe third \u2013 and my preferred option \u2013 is to turn the page to Delia\u2019s recipe for Irish tea bread, which I made out of curiosity while waiting for the cake mixture to mature. It\u2019s simple, delicious \u2013 and to me, really tastes like Christmas.\n"},

Do they get less severe with age? And what drug treatments are on the horizon?", "title": "Everything you ever wanted to know about migraines (but were in too much pain to ask)", "text": "One in seven people around the world suffer from migraine. In the UK, migraine has a crippling economic effect, with approximately 25m days lost every year, costing the country \u00a32.3bn. But while the condition has been studied since the time of the ancient Greeks \u2013 who attempted to treat it with trepanning, by drilling a hole into the skull to release evil spirits \u2013 it remains poorly understood with few adequate treatments.\nMigraine is an inherited disorder characterised by episodes of throbbing head pain. Many patients also report nausea, sensory hyperactivity, with ordinary volumes of sound or light seeming intolerably loud or bright. Others experience aura or neurological abnormalities such as vertigo, temporary blindness and numbness. Some rare types, such as hemiplegic migraine, are single gene disorders, with a particular mutation predisposing individuals to neuronal hyperactivity, meaning that areas of the brain involved in interpreting sensory events can be easily activated. But most common forms are polygenic \u2013 in which a constellation of genes contribute. Various environmental triggers are also strongly associated with migraine, including stress, skipping meals and lack of adequate sleep.\nOur understanding of the neurological processes is still limited, but scientists are starting to put some of the pieces together. \u201cWe know that dilation of blood vessels may play a role and some of the newer treatments try to inhibit this,\u201d says Elizabeth Loder, professor of neurology at Harvard medical school.\nSerious research into migraine began only relatively recently, as for a long time many doctors believed that it was a psychosomatic condition produced by people being unable to deal with stress. \u201cIt was a disorder that most obviously affected women and so wasn\u2019t taken as seriously,\u201d Loder says. \u201cAnd it\u2019s a pain disorder. Pain is subjective: we don\u2019t have any way of measuring it, which can make it very hard for people to believe it\u2019s real. Plus, on top of all of that, it\u2019s episodic, so between attacks, sufferers may look perfectly well.\u201d\nThe fact that migraine is researched at all owes a lot to the development of the medication methysergide in 1960, which was found to eliminate headaches in weeks. The drug is no longer commercially available as it was found to have serious side-effects, but its legacy remains. What had been perceived as a psychological condition clearly had a biological basis. \u201cThe market is, of course, very big,\u201d Loder says. \u201cIt\u2019s a common disorder, it lasts decades. So, that made pharmaceutical companies sit up and take notice; money poured into the field; it improved and professionalised research.\u201d\nHowever, migraine receives much less funding, compared with similarly debilitating conditions. Studies looking at money allocated by the US National Institute of Health, for example, have shown that migraine is considerably underfunded.\nMigraine is extremely common in both sexes but statistics suggest that it is more prevalent in women. Reports in the US estimate that, while 12% of the population has had an attack in the past year, this rises to 18% when women alone are considered.\nScientists suspect that cycling ovarian steroid hormones, in particular the drop in oestrogen that occurs during the menstrual cycle, are particularly provocative, especially for those genetically susceptible to the disorder. The dissipation of these hormones with age explains why some women find that migraine attacks become less common as they get older.\n\u201cI think women with the disorder are more likely than men to be accurately diagnosed with migraine,\u201d Loder says. \u201cWomen see doctors more and are less likely to be hesitant to complain about head pain than men are. Some research shows that men with the disorder tend to be investigated for other causes of headache, suggesting that doctors have a cognitive bias and they don\u2019t think of migraine as readily as they do with women.\u201d\nThe disorder is most active and troublesome during the middle years of life, when people would otherwise be at their most productive, and typically don\u2019t have as many competing causes of disability. But as you get older, the effects usually seem to diminish.\n\u201cClinically it\u2019s extremely unusual to see people in their 60s, 70s and older saying that their migraines are just as bad as they have always been,\u201d Loder says. \u201cIt does happen, but it\u2019s so uncommon that everybody sits up and takes note.\u201d\n It is thought that some of the processes that produce a severe migraine cannot happen as efficiently in older people. As we age, our arteries become stiffer and some of the vascular events that cause migraine can\u2019t happen as easily.\nA class of medications called triptans are typically prescribed. However, about 30-40% of migraine patients don\u2019t respond to the first triptan prescribed, and, for those who don\u2019t respond at all, there are few alternatives \u2013 no new migraine drugs have been developed since the early 90s. In addition, pain relief from triptans is relatively slow \u2013 they often take 45-90 minutes to take effect.\nFor chronic migraine sufferers \u2013 those who experience headaches on more than 15 days a month \u2013 the effectiveness of treatment is particularly poor, with many medications causing side-effects such as sedation, dizziness and mood change.\n\u201cThe problem is that a number of the drugs currently prescribed weren\u2019t originally developed for migraine,\u201d says Brendan Davies, consultant neurologist at University Hospitals of North Midlands and a trustee of the Migraine Trust. \u201cThey were initially developed for epilepsy or depression, before they were found to be potentially beneficial for migraine, and so they work on pathways in the brain which may not be migraine specific.\u201d\nTriptans are referred to as \u201cabortive medicines\u201d, as they treat an individual migraine attack, but drug companies are looking at injections that could prevent migraines from starting. Levels of one particular protein, CGRP, a very powerful vasodilating substance, have been found to shoot up during migraine attacks. Another protein, PACAP, is also thought to be a promising new drug target. So far, the companies have invested heavily in developing antibodies that can bind to CGRP molecules and block them. These are typically administered via monthly injections, rather than daily tablets. \u201cSo far, the results of all the published studies suggest that these treatments do work better than placebo,\u201d Loder says. \u201cThey don\u2019t completely eliminate headaches, but they reduce their frequency. In one recent study of a group who had, on average, 18 headache days a month, people who took the drug had an average reduction of 6.6 days compared with 4.2 days in those who took a placebo. The difference between drug and placebo is modest but there is an effect.\u201d\nHowever, so far only half of migraine sufferers appear to respond to CGRP antibodies, and there is no way of predicting who will benefit. In addition, little is known of the long-term consequences of blocking CGRP. \u201cI\u2019m cautiously optimistic,\u201d Loder says. \u201cFirst, these treatments are likely to be very costly, and second, CGRP is very widely distributed through the body, and there\u2019s some suggestion from animal studies that there could be long-term side-effects. They could turn out to be safe medications, but we\u2019re speculating. If you think about antibodies which have been developed for common neurologic illnesses such as MS, there have been long-term safety concerns.\u201d\n"},

Now thousands of women are using Natural Cycles to prevent \u2013 and plan \u2013 pregnancy", "title": "Could an algorithm replace the pill?", "text": "IUDs, implants, condoms and the ever-present pill: for years, contraceptive methods have remained run-of-the-mill while the search for a new alternative that could revolutionise the industry has come up short. Recent headlines have focused on the negative aspects of traditional hormonal birth control: the pill causes depression and gender mutation in freshwater fish, while a clinical trial for a male contraceptive jab was abandoned when the subjects began suffering side-effects already well-known to women.\nBut 50 years since it first became available, the pill remains the default option, and women still shoulder the responsibility for preventing pregnancies. Could software be the solution? Elina Berglund Scherwitzl, founder and chief technical officer of mobile fertility app Natural Cycles thinks so.\nUsing a sensitive thermometer and sophisticated mathematics, Natural Cycles is an old-fashioned period tracker, with extra features. The app, which launched in 2014, asks users to take their temperatures in the morning, preferably before getting out of bed, then input that into the app, which tells them where they are in their menstrual cycle. Days when a woman can get pregnant become red; \u201csafe\u201d days are green. So far, so low-tech. What makes Natural Cycles unique, though, is the algorithm developed by Berglund.\nThe 32-year-old from Malm\u00f6 in Sweden holds a PhD in particle physics and was a member of the team that discovered the Higgs boson at Cern, before developing her life-changing formula.\nThrough daily use, the algorithm learns not just how to map an individual\u2019s ovulation but to predict it, too. That allows the five days prior to ovulation to be identified in real time, alerting women to the fact that male sperm can linger for that long in their bodies, ready to pounce on an egg when it is released.\nThe app fills a gap in the market, spotted by Berglund when she felt fed up with the limited options on offer other than hormonal contraception. She devised the algorithm and started mapping her own cycle, as well as those of female colleagues at Cern. It proved so succesful that Berglund and her husband, fellow physicist and Natural Cycle\u2019s CEO Raoul Scherwitzl, decided to devote more time to the app.\nBerglund has hired a team of researchers that includes Kristina Gemzell Danielsson, a professor in obstetrics and gynaecology at Karolinska Institutet in Stockholm. Their most recently published clinical study showed that Natural Cycles, when used correctly, is as efficient in preventing pregnancies as the pill. Unlike the pill, though, it doesn\u2019t offer any cover for fertile days, which means that comparing the app to medical contraception can be tricky.\nAsking women to put faith in their phones to protect them from getting pregnant is a complicated business. In Sweden, the app was criticised for targeting young lifestyle bloggers and their impressionable readers. One example was Blondinbella, by Isabella L\u00f6wengrip, who is now a Natural Cycles investor. (L\u00f6wengrip says that the average age of her 1.3 million weekly readers is just over 30 \u2013 two years older than the typical Natural Cycles subscriber.) In December last year, the Swedish Medical Products Agency also banned the app from calling itself a preventivmedel \u2013 the Swedish word for \u201ccontraception\u201d, which is associated with purely medical birth control. As a result, it\u2019s now marketed as a \u201cfertility monitoring device\u201d that \u201ccan be used to avoid pregnancies\u201d. Berglund doesn\u2019t seem too worried, though.\n\u201cWhat we do is track fertility, right? And then women can use it how they want \u2013 it\u2019s a tool for them to use this information either to prevent or plan a pregnancy.\u201d Plus, she says, the company\u2019s research shows that younger women are more disciplined in using contraception on red days; their pregnancy rates were much lower than those of users above the age of 35.\nThe ideal app user, Berglund says, is a woman in a stable relationship who is planning to have children at some point, and who would like a break from hormonal contraception ahead of trying. Gemzell Danielsson points out that it\u2019s not a good option for women who absolutely want to avoid a pregnancy. Nor does she recommend it for anyone who has what she describes as \u201can irregular lifestyle\u201d, irregular menstrual cycles or lacks the motivation to stay on top of their cycles. The latter of these categories might account for the 45% drop-out rate that the app is currently experiencing; women who sign up but fail to keep to their thermometer schedule.\nThe most important thing about Natural Cycles, Berglund and Gemzell Danielsson argue, is that it adds an alternative method to the mix. \u201cI\u2019m still surprised that there hasn\u2019t been such a product before,\u201d Berglund says. \u201cI have been thinking about this since I was a teenager, because I didn\u2019t feel well from taking the pill.\u201d\nBerglund is critical of the conveyor-belt style in which young women are prescribed it, and the fact that birth control is still very one-sided within relationships. \u201cSweden is supposed to be the most gender-equal country, but I think when it comes to contraception \u2026 the burden is very much on the woman.\u201d Natural Cycles, she insists, is \u201cmore of a couple\u2019s thing \u2013 the woman measures her temperature and the man sometimes has to wear a condom.\u201d \u201d\nThe most important thing for the company, Berglund says, is to gain trust. \u201cThat\u2019s why we keep performing clinical studies and why we try to achieve a higher ISO class of medical device status.\u201d\nBut before Natural Cycles can become as trustworthy a contraceptive option as hormonal methods, larger-scale, independent studies will need to prove its efficacy. So while the app hasn\u2019t killed the pill just yet, it is a welcome addition.\n"},

But what started as a light-hearted project suddenly turned very serious", "title": "New man becomes new dad \u2013 the very hard way", "text": "Devorah Baum is having a baby; her husband, Josh Appignanesi, is making a film about her having a baby. Or to be more precise, Josh\u2019s film is about what he feels about the pregnancy: because it\u2019s hard work, this pregnancy lark, for Josh. While Devorah is hoping against hope that, after three years of fertility treatment, the couple really are going to become parents, Josh is doing the really difficult bit of pregnancy: he\u2019s having a full-on, no-holds-barred existential crisis. On camera.\nHow is it for a man in the 21st century when his partner is pregnant? History has changed everything: Stone Age Josh would have gone out hunter-gathering, prepared a safe nest, fought off intruders and brought back food. Modern-day Josh is sitting in his kitchen while his wife and her girlfriends shriek with delight at news of the conception; and then the further bit of news, which is that there are in fact two heartbeats, not one. He is looking very, very scared. What does pregnancy mean for a man in the 21st century? Josh isn\u2019t the main earner. Devorah is the one with a job; Josh is the freelance, and right now he\u2019s the freelance with no work. These were, in fact, the circumstances that led to the project. \u201cJosh thought he was going to make a romcom in Italy,\u201d says Devorah, when we meet at their house in west London. \u201cAnd he said, if it falls through I\u2019ll just have to make a film about us. And suddenly it did fall through, and there he was making this film about us.\u201d\nThe result is The New Man \u2013 executive produced by David Baddiel whose 2010 film Infidel Josh directed \u2013 which opens in cinemas from 21 November. In the film, Devorah humours Josh, telling her friends she\u2019s agreed to be filmed because it\u2019s good for her husband, that making this film is giving him the space to explore his worries and anxieties about impending parenthood. Josh canvasses his male friends who are already fathers, naming those deep-seated concerns that all dads-to-be have, but few articulate (and certainly not on film). \u201cDid you feel you were being usurped? Or fear being usurped \u2026 that you were redundant, you didn\u2019t have a role? That\u2019s it: you gave the sperm, now Mummy has her little boy? Oedipal complex?\u201d\nHis friends are mumbling something that sounds like \u201cNo, no\u201d; but Josh has opened his floodgates, and the fears keep hurtling out. \u201cThere\u2019s not [going to be] enough time for me, there\u2019s not [going to be] enough love. I\u2019m someone who needs endless affection and attention and then suddenly there\u2019s this kid who needs it more than I do \u2026\u201d\nThrough most of the first half of the film, Josh looks like he\u2019s stumbled into the wrong movie. Unkempt, ramshackle, sitting around in his boxer shorts and socks, alternately pouring out his angst and ostentatiously internalising it, his grim distraction is a constant foil to the glowing Devorah\u2019s keeping-a-lid-on-it excitement as the weeks go by, and it seems more and more likely that the couple really are going to have two babies.\nAnd then, everything changes.\nIt\u2019s the 20-week scan, but true to his complex form, Josh has decided to absent himself and have a holiday in Spain with a friend. When he talked to Devorah initially she was fine with it; her mum has gone along to the hospital with her, and they\u2019re going to call him as soon as it\u2019s all over and they know the sexes of the babies, and that everything is OK. So we have Josh sitting beside an idyllic harbour in his shorts, and we have Devorah\u2019s mum phoning from the clinic with updates on how things are going. And even before the bad news, we have the sense that the increasingly agitated Josh has realised that this really isn\u2019t OK, that he should be with Devorah, that he\u2019s let her down by being away on holiday when she\u2019s negotiating such a big hurdle in the pregnancy on her own. \u201cFuck,\u201d he says, as the sun glistens on the water behind him. \u201cIt\u2019s stressful.\u201d\nAnd that is more or less the last moment in the film when it\u2019s all about Josh: because while he\u2019s on a Spanish balcony, Devorah is in a London hospital being told that one of their twin boys has a genetic abnormality and will not survive. Worse, she must carry his body through to delivery, so her womb will be a coffin as well as an incubator. And, even worse still, the dead twin may precipitate labour, in which case the unaffected twin may not make it, either.\nJosh doesn\u2019t say \u201cfuck\u201d so much after that, but now he\u2019d be entirely entitled to say that, and more often. The earth has shifted and his self-absorbed philosophical crisis has become a tragic, practical crisis in real time. And dreadful though it is, the appalling turn of events has given him his role: he must support Devorah, and he must reassure her, and keep on reassuring her, that all will be well. When a friend jokes, \u201cHow\u2019s your sex life?\u201d, Josh dismisses the question as no longer of real relevance. \u201cNo sex,\u201d he says quietly, and without any angst at all.\nAt this point, Josh explains when we meet, the film went from being an arty cri de coeur to being his prop as his world slowly crumbled around him. \u201cI wasn\u2019t coping,\u201d he admits. \u201cSometimes all I could do was turn the camera on.\u201d The movie kept him going, and he helped Devorah keep going. \u201cWe went from doing something that\u2019s so normal and ordinary \u2013 having a baby \u2013 to something that\u2019s really unusual and far less common, which is losing a baby \u2026\u201d And the circumstances of the loss were particularly confusing. \u201cThere was this clash of life narratives,\u201d says Josh. \u201cBirth is supposed to be this wonderful thing, a miracle, a time for celebration. But for us it was also about grief and loss. It was weird. We didn\u2019t know which way to go.\u201d\nThe Josh of today seems more grown up than the Josh of the film. He\u2019s still running his fingers through his curls, but the little-boy-lost look has gone. Because he\u2019s now a dad; a father of two. Manny, the twin who survived the pregnancy, is two and a half, and a surprise natural pregnancy followed quickly, so he has a seven-month-old brother, Isaiah. But it\u2019s not only the hurly-burly of family life that\u2019s changed Josh: something else altered him, something awful and deeply poignant, something we see at close quarters in his film. Because while Devorah and Manny were still in hospital, recovering from the birth, Josh had to take the tiny coffin containing Manny\u2019s twin, Ben, to a graveyard. He is seen beside the undertaker, heaping soil on to the small box, doing the most unnatural thing any of us is ever called to do on this earth: saying goodbye to a child who has predeceased us.\nAt screenings of the film they attend, Devorah and Josh always leave halfway through, before the section about the 20-week scan and loss of Ben. \u201cWhy would you put yourself through all that?\u201d asks Devorah. \u201cIt brings it all back \u2013 what\u2019s the point?\u201d Ben will always be in their hearts, but life with Manny and Isaiah is to the fore in their lives now.\nBut what about all Josh\u2019s fears? There are two new men in Devorah\u2019s life now, after all \u2013 so how is he coping? Well, he says, no question: he was right all along. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot less time for me. Fewer cuddles, less sex. All the things I worried about in the film are true. But what I couldn\u2019t have predicted was how it feels to have children. The love affair between me and my sons is overwhelming \u2013 and that\u2019s the part I couldn\u2019t have anticipated. That\u2019s the bit I couldn\u2019t have known.\u201d\n\u2022 The New Man is released on 21 November\n"},

What can they do about it?", "title": "\u2018I was so embarrassed I cried\u2019: do parents share too much online?", "text": "Picture a child entering the world, around the time that a new social networking venture known as thefacebook.com is making its own entrance to the world. It is 2004, and the child is easy to picture. Her parents have photographed their daughter\u2019s first breath, first smile, first spoonfuls and first steps. When she reaches school age, she is snapped in uniform, probably outside the front door, and one parent, probably her mother, shares the image with friends. The child learns to read, write her name. She wins certificates, excels at sport. When Twitter, Instagram and later Vine arrive, her public identities multiply. She starts secondary school.\nIn a few months, this child and her classmates will begin to turn 13 and, perhaps, create their own Facebook accounts. When they do, they will come face to face with their digital shadow. They may step into it easily, or try to sever themselves from it, but it won\u2019t let go, this pre-existent media identity, because it has logged their lives from the moment they left the womb. Some will recognise their digital shadow, but what of those whose online identity bears little relation to their sense of self, or to the public identity they want to share? For years, parents have fretted about their children\u2019s posting activities, while continuing to post as they wish about their offspring. Is it time they stopped \u2013 or at least asked for permission first?\nToday these questions are on the minds of the children at Kingsford community school in Beckton, east London, where the 13-, 14- and 15-year-old members of the Debate Mate after-school club are filing into a classroom on the first floor, slinging down school bags and glancing at the motion on the whiteboard. \u201cThis house would ban parents from posting about their children on social media,\u201d the debate leader writes.\n\u201cIt\u2019s kind of weird your parents are still posting pictures of you on social media,\u201d someone says. One boy, Malachi, bows his head and writes a single word on his notepad: reputation. \u201cThis is really about consent,\u201d his friend says. \u201cDo I want to be seen by a larger, broader range of people?\u201d There is a loud hum of agreement and one girl raises her voice: \u201cParents! We don\u2019t want them invading our privacy. Because some of us, the only privacy we get is through social media.\u201d\nThese pupils often discuss social networking sites, their attractions and perils, but this is the first time they have turned their scrutiny on their own parents. And yet parents are the object of an increasingly aggressive interrogation. This spring a mother from Shropshire called out her son\u2019s bullying on Facebook, only for the post to go viral; the criticism of her became so intense she removed it and changed her Facebook page and phone number. Next came the 20-year-old mother from Balloch, Scotland, whose photographs of her 11-month-old daughter in tiny high fashion outfits attracted an Instagram following that included Khlo\u00e9 Kardashian \u2013 until critics claimed the woman was sexualising her baby. She has since locked the account and gone to ground. After her came the Arizona father who nakedly cradled his naked, feverish baby in the shower, an image his wife snapped and shared, before Facebook removed it as offensive.\nExcessive sharing about your children has long incited disapproval, but recently the disapproval has begun to acquire a proto-legal tinge. In March, French police warned parents against posting photos of their children on social media; according to social media analyst Eric Delcroix, the children could soon be able to sue them for posting inappropriate pictures, under the country\u2019s privacy laws. The treasurer of the UK\u2019s Human Rights Lawyers Association, Leanne Targett-Parker, echoes the idea that it is only a matter of time before children mount legal challenges against oversharing parents. \u201cYou can\u2019t imagine it not being something that starts to develop within the next five to 10 years,\u201d she says. \u201cI can\u2019t see how there can\u2019t be attempts at suing people for putting up posts that they\u2019re unhappy with.\u201d\nSome parents may shrug off the shaming stories \u2013 and the professionalised sharing of family vloggers such as the Shaytards, the Brataleys, the Ballingers \u2013 as beyond the range of their own moderate social media activity. But listen to the children in the Kingsford classroom and it becomes clear how many degrees there are of shame. To these teenagers, even small instances of sharing can be divisive. When I ask if anyone has experienced being overshared themselves, hands shoot up, but the answers are a long way from the public shaming that normally grabs headlines. They are exactly the sort of infringements that many parents will commit without a second thought.\n\u201cI was eating a Subway. Chicken teriyaki. Eating that and my mum just took the picture and posted it on Facebook,\u201d one pupil says.\n\u201cWhen I was little my parents took a picture of me being potty-trained. Three weeks ago they posted it on Facebook. Me on the toilet. It was really embarrassing,\u201d another adds.\n\u201cI was with my aunt in the park. I was wearing my scarf but I didn\u2019t have a pin. It flew off and my hair was all raggedy, sticking up all over the place. My auntie put it on Facebook. I was so embarrassed I was crying. I asked her to take it down but she said, \u2018No, it looks cute.\u2019\u201d\n\u201cMy uncle posted when his daughter had diarrhoea: \u2018Pray for her.\u2019\u201d\nOne girl, 14, raises her hand. \u201cParents love to post things about you, personal information that you might not like,\u201d she says. \u201cWhich kind of affects your relationship with them. Now, when you want to speak to them about certain things, you\u2019re worried they might post it.\u201d\nHer classmate Erin stands up. Her team supports the motion on the whiteboard \u2013 that parents should be banned from posting \u2013 and they have an idea. \u201cWe want to pass a law that requires open forms of social media to put a consent button on their pages, so a child can report whether their parents have posted about them without consent,\u201d she declares. \u201cIf parents refuse to cooperate, they will be fined the amount of \u00a31,000.\u201d\nThese suggestions may sound excessive and unfeasible; in fact they lie squarely within the recommendations made by a number of adults campaigning in this field. Erin\u2019s idea of a penalty, for instance, echoes the attempts by a Democratic state representative in Illinois, La Shawn K Ford, to make the shaming of children on social networking sites an offence. Offending parents should face a penalty, he has argued, which, just like Erin\u2019s, would be a fine paid directly to the child. As for the apparently far-fetched idea of a \u201cconsent button\u201d, this sounds uncannily similar to the \u201cdelete button\u201d proposed by 5Rights, the campaign steered by the peer and film-maker Beeban Kidron to protect and empower children online.\nMore generally, the debaters\u2019 irritation chimes with research published in March by a team at the University of Michigan. After interviewing 249 parent-children pairings across 40 US states, the researchers found that children were more than twice as likely as parents to say that adults should not post information online about them without permission. Would the Kingsford children concur? Class E11 rings with shouts of, \u201cYes!\u201d\n\u201cIt ain\u2019t going to happen,\u201d their teacher, Miss Alimi, says.\n\u201cMiss!\u201d one of her students cries. \u201cThere\u2019s a thing called wishful thinking.\u201d\n***\nMiss Alimi is right: children are unlikely to gain control over their parents\u2019 posting habits. But there is still scope for a conversation about what constitutes fair sharing, and each family will draw its lines differently. Consider the case of Heather Whitten, the Arizona-based photographer and teaching assistant who took the photograph of her husband and son in the shower that Facebook didn\u2019t like. Whitten saw the moment, and the image, as the height of parental care. Their toddler, Fox, had had a temperature for hours. Her husband, Thomas, was trying to cool the child\u2019s fever. For two years, Whitten kept the image private, finally posting it in May after Facebook removed other pictures she had shared of her children. She wanted to take a stand, \u201cto show that it\u2019s just innocent pictures that people are twisting and getting offended by\u201d.\nShe was unprepared for the response \u2013 for the way in which Facebook removed images from her page every time it received sufficient complaints, for the level of disapproval the image provoked, including claims that it was \u201csexual\u201d or \u201cinappropriate\u201d. But Whitten\u2019s stand had one other unexpected consequence. As the interested and the outraged followed the link to her blog, some began to question the legality, as well as the sense, of showing children naked. \u201cI just thought you were free to post what you wanted on the internet,\u201d Whitten says now. But then she discovered that in the state of Arizona, \u201cyou can\u2019t show any naked images of children\u2019s pelvic area or butt, and I realised I was technically breaking a law.\u201d\nShe removed the blog \u2013 \u201ctook everything down\u201d \u2013 but \u201cin the bigger, moral sense, I don\u2019t feel I\u2019ve done anything wrong. I\u2019m not exploiting my children. I\u2019m not abusing my children. I\u2019m just sharing our lives exactly how they are.\u201d\nWhitten\u2019s experience shows just how nebulous and fraught the territory of sharing can be. Sure, her experience would never befall those for whom posting naked images of children is strictly out of bounds. But the case of Whitten is complicated. She and her partner are raising their children \u201cto not be ashamed or embarrassed of their bodies\u201d. They are living online within the offline boundaries they have set for themselves. \u201cPeople don\u2019t show nudity a lot of times because they think it will have a negative impact on their child. Your footprint is for ever on the internet,\u201d Whitten says. \u201cFor me, it\u2019s absurd. I just hope to combat that a little. Who knows how it will actually turn out, but I hope that my children won\u2019t ever look back and see pictures of themselves as children and feel embarrassed by other people seeing them as well. Because there is nothing to be embarrassed about.\u201d\nFox, the toddler in the shower, is still too young to veto or cherish the photograph that caused such controversy, but his older sister Lily, nine, \u201cloves it\u201d, according to her mother. \u201cShe couldn\u2019t really wrap her head around why people would think there was anything wrong with it.\u201d\nAnd yet, while Lily was comfortable with the image of her baby brother, she was deeply unhappy with other photographs her mother had uploaded \u2013 the apparently harmless kind that many parents post. One day at around the age of six, Lily began to scroll through her mother\u2019s Instagram. \u201cShe saw how many pictures there were of her and she didn\u2019t like it,\u201d Whitten says. For months, whenever Lily saw Whitten with the camera, she hid. \u201cThat really opened up a conversation about why I take pictures, why I share pictures, who I share pictures with.\u201d Now, Whitten says, \u201cany time you see Lily, it is with her permission\u201d.\nAlicia Blum-Ross, a researcher at the London School of Economics, believes we are entering a crucial moment. \u201cWe are starting to see kids who have grown up, whose parents have shared images, and who are beginning to say: \u2018Wait a minute. I\u2019m not sure I\u2019m comfortable with that.\u2019\u201d What families need, she thinks, is a coming-of-age conversation. After all, it was Lily Whitten herself, at six, who instigated the dialogue with her mother that earned her the right to veto content. Does Lily have advice for other children? \u201cThey should say, \u2018Please don\u2019t take any pictures of me \u2013 it makes me uncomfortable,\u2019\u201d she says. \u201cAnd \u2018I might change my mind one day, but today I don\u2019t want to have to hide from your camera.\u2019\u201d Soon this \u201cdigital rulebook\u201d chat might become as standard as the one about the birds and the bees. Blum-Ross sees nothing to fear. Both parties, she points out, are united by being the first generation \u2013 of parents and children \u2013 to negotiate this path. \u201cIt can be a really shared experience,\u201d she says enthusiastically. \u201cThe dilemmas are shared dilemmas, the pleasures are shared pleasures. It\u2019s a moment of overlap.\u201d\nBlum-Ross, who has three-year-old twins, says she is \u201cnot a person who advises total protection. I certainly wouldn\u2019t say, \u2018Don\u2019t share things about your children online.\u2019 It\u2019s important that parents are able to claim their own space about that. It\u2019s OK to say, \u2018I need this community.\u2019\u201d Whitten, too, has always seen her sharing in those terms: \u201cI feel I share everything as my story \u2013 this is my perspective on my life as a mother with these children. I\u2019m not trying to put words in their mouth, or tell the story from their perspective.\u201d\nIt is one of the oldest questions of storytelling: who does the story belong to? Blum-Ross, Whitten and countless others believe they are telling their own stories, and sharing posts about their children where they fit that perspective. But it\u2019s complicated. \u201cI never had a filter before,\u201d says Whitten, sounding forlorn. \u201cI love the idea of having connections with other mothers and people. But I can\u2019t share the way I used to.\u201d After the Facebook furore, she is still fathoming whether to photograph differently or simply stop sharing.\nFor other parents, such as the author Amy Webb, who has written about her commitment to post nothing about her daughter online, the same process of consideration deters them from sharing altogether. They have the big conversation \u2013 with themselves, each other, sometimes their children \u2013 and decide the best answer is silence.\nWhen the Guardian asked readers about their experiences, Apricot, who is 30 and lives in the north of England, wrote: \u201cWhen I started to Facebook my own child\u2019s pictures, I began to feel intensely uncomfortable. How could I instil in her a principle of privacy when I had essentially devalued hers from the beginning?\u201d She stopped posting. \u201cWhat we post is facets of ourselves,\u201d said Tamasine Preece, a teacher in Bridgend, whose PhD includes a chapter on oversharing. \u201cI think there is a morality to using children to explore parts of ourselves. My children are not me. They are separate.\u201d\nKidron, who says she has never interacted with her children on social networking sites (they are now 19 and 21), thinks that her behaviour reflects the idea that \u201coversharing is inappropriate when the whole point of the journey to adulthood is to self-define \u2013 to work out who you are, what your values are, how you\u2019re going to fit in. I think we have not thought hard enough about what that process might be like, if so much is shared and so much is public.\n\u201cThere are three issues here,\u201d she says. \u201cOne is the right to a certain sort of privacy. The second is the need of young people to transgress and bump into their edges, and for that to be somewhat safe. The third is the need to break away from the model of your parents.\u201d\nMy own Facebook posts dried up as I researched this article. Of course, I can ask my children for consent, but I am not sure they are ready for a responsibility with permanent consequences. If an eight-year-old consents to a post, is it fair to act upon that consent, or should a parent second-guess how those feelings might evolve? After all, posts are eternal and a child cannot speak for his or her future self.\nIn any case, a child\u2019s consent can be capricious, even within one given day. My daughter, at eight, would prefer her photo not to appear on Facebook, but would be more than happy to see a video of herself playing Swingball on YouTube. My six-year-old, meanwhile, says he is sad that \u201cGoogle doesn\u2019t know me\u201d. Even the teenagers at Kingsford are conflicted. In the end, they vote against Erin\u2019s suggestion of a fine for parents who share without their children\u2019s consent, but they squirm in their seats, clawing the air for a turn to speak when I ask what rules they would lay down for their parents:\n\u201cDon\u2019t say embarrassing jokes \u2019cos that\u2019s too much.\u201d\n\u201cAs far as the world is concerned, we\u2019re not related.\u201d\n\u201cPost pictures of me when I look amazing.\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t post baby pictures unless I\u2019m happy and fully clothed.\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t ever comment on my pictures.\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t stalk my profile waiting for me to load pictures.\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t follow.\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t add me. Or my friends.\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t tell dad jokes.\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t take pictures of me eating food, \u2019cos my friends take it out of context.\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t try and use internet slang on our wall. On your friends\u2019 profiles you can embarrass yourselves all you want, but when it\u2019s on our profiles it looks like we\u2019ve taught you to say that. And it makes us look really bad.\u201d\n\u201cStay behind the times.\u201d\n***\nOf course, every family is different. In a quiet cul-de-sac in Newton Abbot, Devon, with sunlight pouring into the lounge, Molly Povey and her 11-year-old son Roman are sitting on the sofa discussing their experience of going viral.\nIn April 2015, with Roman desperately unhappy at school, Molly posted a plea on her Facebook page for his classmates\u2019 parents to send her \u201cbeautiful son\u201d birthday cards. \u201cRoman doesn\u2019t have any friends and often cries himself to sleep,\u201d the post began. It was shared around the world. \u201cMaybe 40,000 times,\u201d Molly says. (Interestingly, her post breaks only the second of the Kingsford rules, by disclosing that Molly and Roman are related.)\nNeither Molly nor Roman, nor his two brothers, nor his dad Ian, who says he hates social media, were prepared for what happened next. Thousands of people left birthday greetings online. At the office of a friend \u2013 whose address was hastily borrowed to protect Roman\u2019s privacy \u2013 cards and gifts began to arrive. Molly formalised the chaos into a Cards For Roman Facebook page.\nFriendships were made, and some of them have lasted \u2013 to the extent that in April, a year after his mother\u2019s plea for help, Roman celebrated his 12th birthday with 150 friends, strangers and Facebook friends at a Nando\u2019s in Exeter and at a second party in London. They have even met up with well-wishers in Germany.\nWhile Molly tells this story, talking quickly because there is a lot to fit in, Roman scurries to and fro with his gifts: a Star Wars chess set from someone in the Netherlands, pictures from Brazilian schoolchildren (Molly says he is very big in Brazil), wicker baskets of cards.\nBut sometimes Molly worries. \u201cA bit. I think, what happens in years to come if he Googles himself and finds \u2018Lonely boy with no friends\u2019?\u201d Last year the local paper ran a front-page headline saying just that. \u201cI thought, oh my God, what have I done?\u201d Roman was with her, and comforted her. \u201cBut it is true,\u201d he said. \u201cI am really lonely.\u201d\nFor the Povey family, the benefits of Molly\u2019s post are visible each day. His tearfulness has declined. The whole household is happier. Molly herself has found, in the Facebook page, a community that makes her feel supported and which, in turn, needs her. \u201cAnd now you\u2019ve got a responsibility,\u201d Ian says. \u201cIt\u2019s a strange thing.\u201d He himself has never read the initial post, usually declines to appear in photographs, and thinks that when it comes to sharing, \u201cIt\u2019s best to err on the side of caution.\u201d Occasionally, Molly tells her community that Roman is having a bad day, or that she is: she doesn\u2019t want to pretend to people who know loneliness that loneliness doesn\u2019t happen. And yet, as Ian says, \u201cIt\u2019s difficult to know sometimes what Roman really thinks about it.\u201d\nMolly leads the way up to Roman\u2019s bedroom, to show more of the gifts people sent. There is James Bond notepaper from the actor Andrew Scott, who played the baddie in Spectre, and a crew T-shirt from Star Wars: Episode III.\nI wonder if Roman minds thousands of strangers knowing he\u2019s sad. \u201cDo you mind?\u201d Molly asks him. \u201cDo you mind that people know you get really lonely?\u201d\n\u201cMaybe,\u201d Roman replies. \u201cI don\u2019t know. I\u2019ll go yes: I don\u2019t like it.\u201d\n\u201cYou don\u2019t like it?\u201d Molly repeats, incredulous.\n\u201cNo.\u201d\n\u201cWhat, that people around the world know you are lonely?\u201d\n\u201cYeah.\u201d\n\u201cYou don\u2019t like it now?\u201d she asks again.\n\u201cNo.\u201d\n\u201cOh,\u201d Molly says. She sounds deflated.\n\u201cIt just feels weird, it does,\u201d Roman tells her.\nAlthough Molly has publicly revealed aspects of her son\u2019s emotional life that other parents might hesitate to share, she is not incautious. For months she withheld Roman\u2019s full name and has only recently felt comfortable disclosing that he is autistic. Before her heartfelt post, she deleted baby pictures of Roman\u2019s older brother because he was about to start secondary school; surely the Kingsford debaters would approve.\nLike Alicia Blum-Ross and Heather Whitten, Molly has rules. \u201cThink about whether it\u2019s appropriate \u2013 if in a year or five years your child would be embarrassed by anything you\u2019ve done. And just why are you actually doing it? Is it a positive thing, or is it to give you a social boost as opposed to the children?\u201d Molly might appear to be at the opposite end of the spectrum from Tamasine Preece, who never posts, but the morals that underpin their behaviour are remarkably alike. And while Molly thinks \u201cyou shouldn\u2019t be posting pictures of kids in the bath\u201d, in some ways her posts are as exposing as Whitten\u2019s.\nLater that evening Molly emails to say that the conversation with Roman had troubled her. After I\u2019d left the house, she offered to take down the page, she says, but Roman said not to. \u201cTurns out he was confused in his room and was talking about not liking being lonely, and not his page.\u201d\nOr maybe Roman, in that moment, wished no one knew he was lonely. Then, later, when his mother checked, he minded less. Or maybe he understands that the community his mother has created has benefited him and his family. But these are only guesses. It is impossible to know. He is young, and the world changes many times a day. His parents have his best interests at heart, but like any who share news of their children, every time they post, they cross a line between privacy and publicity. Where each parent sees the line is an unsteady, unsettleable question. For Roman, and others like him, the truth may be something they are still working out, or simply prefer not to share.\nElaine Star, 47, a PA and poet, and her youngest daughter Sadie, 17, a student, live in Brighton \nElaine I\u2019ve had a Facebook account for about 10 years, so Sadie was probably seven when I first joined. I use it to keep in touch with different groups of people \u2013 old friends, my poetry group, the puppet show I work with. I\u2019m also friends with a lot of my kids\u2019 friends, because it\u2019s often the best way of locating where mine are. I don\u2019t think it bothers them. All their friends are happy to come to the house and sit around my kitchen table and chat, so I don\u2019t think it\u2019s odd. I don\u2019t post on their friends\u2019 pages \u2013 maybe just a \u201cHappy birthday\u201d message. But I\u2019m really impressed by the sorts of things they share about science, politics \u2013 they\u2019re very funny and insightful.\nI have definitely made mistakes online. I\u2019ve gone on after a few glasses of wine and said things I shouldn\u2019t have. There have been some angry messages about the state my kids and their friends have left the house in. And they have all asked me to take down various photos. I get it: I\u2019m sensitive to the fact that they\u2019re trying to be cool or whatever.\nI think I\u2019m past the stage of worrying too much about embarrassing my kids. I write poems that are very personal, and I share them on Facebook. But that\u2019s how I express myself. The kids have occasionally said, \u201cStop living your life on Facebook\u201d but I\u2019m an open person.\nThey\u2019re all fairly streetwise. We have a very open dialogue in our house. They have occasionally posted things that I think are a bit questionable \u2013 showing off a bit about drinking with their friends, that sort of thing. I might have said, \u201cHmm, you might want to think about that\u201d but I\u2019ve never said, \u201cTake that down.\u201d I\u2019m glad Facebook wasn\u2019t around to record my teenage years, though. I\u2019d hate it.\nSadie My siblings and I all use Facebook in different ways. Stevie posts a lot of pictures; Maisie likes to talk about stuff. Me and Joe post a lot of news stories, and I like posting videos or songs. I don\u2019t like to put up personal pictures, or get too emotional on Facebook. My mum\u2019s posts can be really personal.\nAt the beginning, I didn\u2019t really want to be friends with her on Facebook. I didn\u2019t really want her seeing pictures of me that my friends had posted. They weren\u2019t anything bad; they just felt like a bit of my life that was separate from her. Now I don\u2019t mind as much \u2013 I\u2019m more open. She\u2019s also friends with a lot of my friends on there. That\u2019s not a problem, except that she\u2019s quite free with what she writes. Something would happen between us, and she\u2019d put it in a poem, and post it to Facebook, and I wondered whether my friends would see her in a different way. I think maybe I felt protective of her. But no one has ever said anything.\nShe has a lot of photos of us when we were little. When I was a bit younger, I hated seeing some of them online. I remember there was one where I was holding my pet hamster and I just thought I looked greasy and rough. And once my room was really messy and my mum said, \u201cI\u2019ll take pictures and put it on Facebook.\u201d I would have hated it if she\u2019d actually done it. Now I\u2019m a bit older, I\u2019ve learned to let go of it all a bit more. I think I\u2019m OK with what\u2019s out there about me.\nJuliet Redelsperger-Talbot, 43, a marketing and events manager, and Nell, 13, live in Eye, Suffolk, with Nell\u2019s father and her brother Lawrence, 10 \nNell I\u2019ve been cyberbullied before. One of my followers on Instagram, someone I knew, turned on me, then a couple of others who I\u2019d thought were friendly were making comments on my posts. It wasn\u2019t nice, and I wasn\u2019t sure how to handle it. In school they give you lessons about what to do if it happens to you, but when it comes to it, the reality is very different. But the school did deal with it.\nAfter that, I became a lot more careful about who I accept as friends, and what people can see. Now I have one account for my photography and a separate one for my closest friends.\nI have looked briefly at Mum\u2019s Facebook account, but I don\u2019t have a clue about how Facebook works. I don\u2019t think I mind that there are photos of me. If you know the people that can see those photos, then that\u2019s OK. If it\u2019s not private, I\u2019m not so sure about that. But I don\u2019t find it embarrassing. Maybe it\u2019s because I don\u2019t feel like the same person I was when I was little. It doesn\u2019t feel as if those pictures are of me.\nJuliet The cyberbullying was a harrowing time for Nell, but what was good was that some of her friends were supportive and took screenshots of the comments as proof of what was happening. Nell was worried I would be angry, so she didn\u2019t come to me until after it was over. It was awful, but in a way, I think it helped her understand what you\u2019re exposed to online.\nNell is a great photographer, and she sends me pictures, but I check that she is happy before I post anything on Facebook. Your children have every right to veto what you put online, although they have to be a certain age before they understand what it means. Neither of mine have ever had an issue with something I\u2019ve posted, but then they\u2019re the generation that are used to having photos of themselves everywhere. I think it meant something different for my generation. It took so long to get photos developed that seeing yourself was so much more important.\nThe children were very little when I first signed up. I don\u2019t remember thinking much about privacy then. It wasn\u2019t until I read in the paper how posts about your children might be seen by complete strangers that I changed my settings.\nAs time went by, I began to feel uncomfortable about posting. It felt like everything online was becoming more about \u201cLook how wonderful I am\u201d and it made me feel quite down. So I left for a while. Eventually I rejoined because it was hard to keep up with everything. So now I\u2019ve started again but in a very different way.\n"},

We need to stop locking up addicts and people who are mentally ill", "title": "As a prison doctor I\u2019ve seen the crisis in jails \u2013 half the inmates shouldn\u2019t be there | Gordon Cameron", "text": "I have worked as a GP over the past decade in about a third of the around 140 prisons in England and Wales \u2013 all categories, male and female \u2013 and in all there has been a gradual increase in the prison population, leading to overcrowding.\nThis reflects the national situation. Ministry of Justice figures show that between June 1993 and June 2012 the prison population in England and Wales increased by 41,800 prisoners, to more than 86,000. Without urgent steps aimed at cutting the prison population this could exceed 100,000 by 2020. However, this has not been matched by a corresponding increase in the number of prison officers. On the contrary, their numbers have been cut.\nWhen our prisons are at crisis point, amid continuing controversy about incidents such as the recent killing at Pentonville, consider our direction of travel. Take HMP Berwyn, the so-called super prison expected to open in February 2017.\nBuilt at the cost of \u00a3212m and located at Wrexham in Wales, HMP Berwyn is expected to accommodate 2,100 category C prisoners \u2013 those who cannot be allowed to move freely but are considered unlikely to try to escape. Instead of taking steps to radically reduce the UK prison population the government keeps building more prisons to house even more prisoners.\nI have come across numerous cases over the years where a noncustodial sentence would have been more appropriate than imprisonment. I recall a heavily pregnant lady suffering from a life-threatening condition who was jailed for breaching a restraining order. What was to be expected of a pregnant sufferer confined for a good deal of the time in a small, poorly ventilated prison cell? During her time behind bars she was rushed to hospital several times. Whenever she was there, for sometimes up to a week and longer, she was guarded round the clock by prison officers.\nI recall another instance when the nurse, seeing the new arrivals on reception duty, sent me the following message, asking me to prescribe a short course of sleeping tablets for a recent arrival. She was in prison for failing to pay a bill. Her partner was supposed to be looking after their young children but, the message said: \u201cshe does not believe he is up to the task. She is in a very weepy state and unable to sleep. She has another four weeks to do \u2013 could you please help?\u201d\nThese women represent a not insignificant proportion of the prison population who are not a \u201cdanger to the public\u201d. So why is the state spending large sums to keep them behind bars?\nMinistry of Justice figures from 2013 revealed that 55% of prisoners connected their offences to drug-taking, with the need for money to buy drugs the most commonly cited factor. Eliminating the addiction factor could lead to the closure of about half the prisons in the UK and free resources for other matters.\nSending these people to jail in the hope of ridding society of the menace of drug abuse is a woefully inadequate approach to the complex problem of drugs. It is akin to a doctor treating the symptoms of a disease without concerning themselves with its cause or its future prevention. There should instead be a holistic approach to the problem of drug addiction, with treatment and rehabilitation forming the centrepiece.\nAnd then there are the inmates with mental health issues. Surely these are best handled in psychiatric institutions rather than prison. Instead of spending millions on \u201csuper prisons\u201d, the state would be better employed building additional psychiatric hospitals and homes to accommodate the hundreds, if not thousands, of them languishing in jail. Instead of helping them to overcome their mental impairment, society is punishing them for a condition they cannot help having. Labelling them criminals on a par with those who commit armed robbery, rape and murder is antiquated at best and nonsensical at worst. Samuel Butler lampooned this stance in his classic satire, Erewhon, describing a culture who imprisoned the sick for the crime of not being well. That was published in 1872, but what has changed since then?\nA report published last month by the RSA\u2019s Future Prison project says the prison and probation services in England and Wales are failing to protect the public because they do not rehabilitate offenders, and that they should be radically restructured. I welcome the rehabilitation aspect, but it still ignores the central issue of population.\nWe need urgently to address sentencing, because too many offenders are being sent to prison for short terms. A record-breaking case was that of a lady who was jailed one evening only to be released the next day. I believe any sentence below three months should be suspended, turned into fines or whatever other punishment society deems appropriate short of an actual prison sentence.\nAs for drug addicts, the power to sentence them to drug rehabilitation homes makes sense for everybody. Keeping the most dangerous criminals \u2013 sex offenders, murderers, terrorists, armed robbers, and so on \u2013 in jail, and finding alternative punishment for those committing petty crimes, would not only lead a radical reduction in the prison population, it would also allow for the proper supervision of extremely dangerous inmates.\nWhatever else is said this week, population reduction is where our focus is and it is quite achievable. What is really needed is the will.\n\u2022 Dr Gordon Cameron is a pseudonym. Memoirs of Her Majesty\u2019s Prison Doctor by Dr Cameron is available now. Visit hmpdoctorsmemoirs.com\n"},

He didn\u2019t seem to want ours \u2013 and that could be a big mistake", "title": "Donald Trump has made it clear: in his America, Muslim citizens don\u2019t exist | Moustafa Bayoumi", "text": "The 2016 American presidential election has been an absurd, exhausting and bruising spectacle. Now imagine living through it all as a Muslim American. Somehow, this election has managed to cram all the Islamophobic sentiments of the last 15 years into the span of 15 months, and then morph them into one ugly thing.\nDonald Trump is largely to blame. He called for \u201ca total and complete shutdown of Muslims\u201d entering the country until it became clear that the proposal was embarrassingly ill-conceived, only to be replaced by the equally vague \u201cextreme vetting\u201d. He fought publicly with the Gold Star Khan family, suggesting Ghazala Khan was not \u201callowed to speak\u201d at the Democratic convention because of her Muslim faith. He accused Muslim Americans as a group of harboring terrorists. There\u2019s more, but we all know the story by now.\nTrump has insulted and defamed many different groups along the way, but what we may not realize is how it\u2019s different when it comes to Muslims. Over the course of the campaign, Trump has very publicly reached out to Latino, African American and LGBTQ voters to ask for their support. We can question his sincerity, but the gestures are there. He even briefly tempered his tone regarding Mexicans during a quickly arranged visit to President Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto in Mexico City last August. \nHis daughter Ivanka and wife Melania have defended him for his unforgivable behavior toward women, and Ivanka also recorded an official campaign television advertisement openly courting women voters for her father. Trump denies the charge he mocked a disabled reporter, and despite a bevy of antisemitic incidents involving Trump and his supporters over the past months, he has also directly sought Jewish American support. Such is his style of leadership: he may insult you, but he still wants your vote. \nNot so with the Muslims. A tiny handful of Muslim Americans may, bizarrely, be Trump supporters, but that doesn\u2019t diminish the fact that, while attempting to engage every other constituency, Trump\u2019s campaign has made essentially zero public outreach to the Muslim electorate. It\u2019s as if Muslim citizens already don\u2019t exist in Trump\u2019s America.\nThe irony is that Trump\u2019s willful blindness to Muslim voters may lead to his defeat. Muslims may only account for a small part of the American population, but a concerted push by Muslim Americans during this season has meant that there are now over a million registered Muslim voters, more than double the number in 2012. And Muslims tend to live in key battleground states such as Florida, Michigan, Ohio and Virginia. \nBut Hillary Clinton may not be able to count on all of those votes either. Many Muslim Americans have long been uncomfortable with her hawkish foreign policy record and her superficially inclusive rhetoric. \u201cWe need American Muslims to be part of our eyes and ears on our frontlines,\u201d is a standard Clinton refrain, and with it we hear the suggestion that our communities live on some kind of \u201cfrontline\u201d of warfare. \nThis is so not true: the front line of Costco, maybe. Most Muslim Americans are boring, middle-class folk. Clinton also seems to see Muslim Americans as separate from her idea of \u201cwe\u201d (\u201cwe\u201d need \u201cthem\u201d to be part of \u201cus\u201d) and to believe that we, as a group, carry some insider knowledge about evildoers that we may \u2013 or may not! \u2013 be willing to trade in exchange for equal treatment in the United States. \nThis is offensive to our citizenship, and Muslim Americans must be afforded the same rights and protections as everyone else without precondition. But what this campaign has really shown is how contested and precarious the place is for Muslim Americans today. That won\u2019t change after 8 November, regardless of who wins. \nEven with a Clinton victory, Trump and his \u201cmovement\u201d, which is how he refers to his campaign, will not simply vanish. And the suggestion that Trump is merely using the election as a platform from which to start a new media empire is hardly comforting, as if there has never been a connection between mass media and far-right politics. So how prepared are we, as a nation, to deal with Trumpism after Tuesday?\nIf there\u2019s any good news to come out of this election, it\u2019s that the country now recognizes the potent political force that is Islamophobia. And Americans are beginning to understand that fighting anti-Muslim bigotry is not fundamentally about protecting Muslims, but about preserving the vision of a functioning, pluralistic and democratic society. Now we must be prepared to do the work necessary to hold our leaders to that standard every day, and not just once every four years.\n"},

But if I were to rely upon how television drama has interpreted the story of my generation, I would not be able to recognise it. Sadly, dramas about events that occurred in my youth deal almost exclusively with the pageant of nobility.\nIt concerns me that the history of my generation may be lost to my grandchildren because television producers would rather anaesthetise viewers from the unpleasantness of our past with idolatry for the aristocracy and the monarchy.\nIt\u2019s why I am angry that Netflix has spent $130m (\u00a3105m) on the 10-part series The Crown. This is a biopic concerning the marriage of Queen Elizabeth when she was still a princess in 1947, followed by her coronation in 1953. Unfortunately, The Crown views postwar Britain from the perspective of our sovereign and all who inhabited her world. This does an enormous disservice to the epoch, because it was a time when a socialist tide raised all boats. History was literally being made from the bottom up because, while Princess Elizabeth was being fitted for her wedding dress, ordinary Britons were dismantling a thousand years of feudal mentality through the creation of the welfare state.\nWe\u2019ve seen this approach before. Nothing better illustrates TV\u2019s lush treacle homage to the landed gentry than Downton Abbey, a drama that ran for six series as a parlour-room interpretation of historical moments that shaped Britain at the turn of the 20th century. But Downton has not been the exception to the rule, rather a template used by TV and movie producers to crush the truth from history and make the entitled the heroes of narratives about our nation\u2019s collective past.\nThe Crown, like Downton Abbey, Victoria or even Indian Summers, depicts moments in history as a pageant in which the wealthy, the entitled and the nobility oversee the lives of millions with benevolence, wisdom and grace. As I have been both a witness to and participant in history since 1923, I can tell you that was not the case. Millions lived lives of abject misery during the 1930s while the 1% of that time enjoyed an obscene opulence. Despite the vast wealth of 19th-century history a TV dramatist can draw upon, our nation\u2019s rich heritage too often becomes an infomercial for monarchy and empire.\nThe Crown is like an expensive painting in which the only subjects in focus are the rich and privileged. Everyone else, people like me or your grandparents if they came from the working class and even the middle class, are considered no more than background scenery. We are the undefined face in the crowd waving religiously at our so-called betters.\nTo my mind, The Crown is an insult to the struggles my generation overcame and the triumphs we earned from our sacrifices in both war and in peace. But what is most frightening is that the tableau of our past shown on Netflix and other TV networks will be most people\u2019s window on my generation\u2019s history. Too many in the 19th and early 20th century lived thwarted lives because of the exploitation they endured in the mines and mills. Yet no one tells the tale of these workers unionising, fighting for their rights or trying to find and maintain love in the harsh conditions of the slums they called home.\nToo many of my generation died young because they lacked the money to pay for a doctor, but in The Crown our sympathies are directed to a king dying of lung cancer rather than the thousands of miners who died painfully of black lung because that monarch and his society didn\u2019t believe the average citizen deserved medicine if they couldn\u2019t afford to pay for it.\nOur Queen, no matter how much we should respect her service to the state, doesn\u2019t deserve to be turned into a cinematic icon. In the great sweep of events our monarch is like a garden ornament sitting immutably on the field of history because she is not the author of our nation\u2019s destiny.\nBecause of austerity and Brexit, Britain has become a house divided. We need now more than ever our great film-makers and television producers to tell the stories from our collective past that reflect all its pathos and wonder. And they need to tell it from the perspective of those ordinary, brilliant and profound men and women who, a lifetime ago, helped shape the way we live today through their deeds.\n"},

But she let them down badly", "title": "Liz Truss swore to defend the judiciary. But she stood by as they got a roasting | Richard Burgon", "text": "We all believe in freedom of speech. But freedom of speech must be exercised responsibly. Last Thursday\u2019s judgment from the high court on article 50 led to artificial hysteria in many quarters. There were headlines declaring that the judges who heard the case were \u201cEnemies of the people\u201d; references alluding to the sexuality of a judge briefly appeared on the Daily Mail\u2019s website; and a member of the cabinet, Sajid Javid, ominously stated that \u201cThis is an attempt to frustrate the will of the British people and it is unacceptable\u201d.\nMany have said that those headlines and comments \u201ccrossed the line\u201d. And in our constitution, when judicial independence is threatened, the lord chancellor has a legal duty to intervene. Liz Truss, however, failed to say anything for nearly 48 hours and when she did, she simply recited the principle of the independence of the judiciary and stated the government would be appealing against the judgment. She did not condemn the fact that our judges had been declared \u201cenemies of the people\u201d, nor that the sexuality of a judge had been introduced in to the debate.\nWhen Truss took office she swore an oath to uphold the independence of the judiciary and the rule of law. In her speech that day she committed to doing so \u201cwith dedication\u201d. The headlines which appeared in a number of newspapers the day after the high court ruling in the article 50 case was the first test of her commitment. On any reasonable measure, she failed that test.\nThat\u2019s not just my view. The former lord chief justice, Lord Judge, was interviewed on Radio 4 on Sunday and said this: \u201cThe lord chancellor has a specific function and in this case her responsibility, where there has been vituperative criticism of judges, damaging to public confidence in the administration of justice by an independent judiciary, is to speak up for them and explain exactly what the principles are.\u201d\nHe went on to say about Truss\u2019s response to the attacks: \u201cI think it was a little too late and I think it\u2019s quite a lot too little. Because it doesn\u2019t actually address the damage to public confidence consequent on [these] kind of headlines.\u201d\nDuring my 10 years as a lawyer before being elected to parliament and then becoming shadow lord chancellor, there were occasions when I disagreed with \u2013 or was disappointed with \u2013 judges\u2019 decisions. When I lost a case, I was disappointed. When I won a case, the lawyer on the other side was disappointed. But we would never tolerate our judiciary being declared as \u201cagainst the people\u201d or a judge\u2019s sexuality being brought into the debate.\nAnyone is free to disagree with a judge\u2019s decision, their reasoning \u2013 or lack of it \u2013 or their interpretation of the law. But what is surely unacceptable is attacks on the independence of the judiciary by government ministers and powerful government-backing newspapers. The lord chancellor has a duty to act in these circumstances and she failed.\nIt took a bar council resolution demanding action to draw her into the open. And then she provided a statement carefully crafted to say as little as possible, which has only attracted further criticism. And since then she has remained out of sight. Conservative MPs mindful of the rule of law have criticised her publicly and, reportedly, privately, at a fractious meeting of Tory MPs at which she is supposed to have said that it is the job of the lord chief justice to defend the judiciary. Actually, it is Truss\u2019s statutory responsibility \u2013 and the lord chief justice is one of the judges who heard the case and is being maligned.\nI know Truss has a lot on, given the crisis of violence and underfunding that has developed in our prison service, but for many in the legal community, studied silence on this specific matter means a lord chancellor loses their trust and confidence. Her failure to speak out has consequences: only yesterday afternoon, during a debate on Brexit in the Commons, David Davis repeatedly failed to condemn the headlines when asked. Other MPs have spoken about the judiciary \u201cinterfering between parliament and the executive\u201d.\nWhether it\u2019s respecting the outcome of referendums (even when the result disappoints the Labour party) or defending the independence of the judiciary, Labour is the party of the rule of law. A mature democracy \u2013 and a mature government \u2013 doesn\u2019t stand by while the judiciary gets a roasting.\n"},

Please don\u2019t give us Brazilians in place of buttons and bows", "title": "Hands off our haberdashery, John Lewis. Waxing is no replacement | Nell Frizzell", "text": "John Lewis is Debenhams for people with labradors, and they\u2019ll never get my pubes.\nHaving grown up in a city without one, I have often been struck by the cult-like way in which people talk about John Lewis. I have seen grown men brought almost to tears discussing its bedding selection and choice of lightbulbs. I\u2019ve sat through literally hours of office chat about its \u201cnever knowingly undersold\u201d commitment and geisha-like customer service. I\u2019ve heard it\u2019s where people have their wedding lists.\nAll of which makes the fact that John Lewis is moving into the sticky-fingered business of bikini waxes all the more disquieting.\nNow, let us be clear \u2013 your hair is your hair and you have complete authority over what you do with it. You can thank the My Body, My Rules school of feminism for that. But, when it comes to the decision between haberdashery and hair removal, I\u2019m afraid I have to take issue with the latter.\nWhen the Sunday Times, after interviewing John Lewis\u2019s new managing director, Paula Nickolds (who in fact started her career in the sewing department of the organisation), says that the \u201ctraditional products, including hats and haberdashery, are being downgraded in favour of new services, including holidays, in-store prosecco bars and bikini waxes\u201d it makes me want to weave myself a row-boat out of leg hair and sail away to the horizon.\nJohn Lewis today reassured customers that they \u201chave no plans to close or downgrade our haberdashery departments. Haberdashery is woven into the fabric of our business and there are no plans to unstitch it.\u201d But such rumours are unnerving, not least because the better part of life lies in creating things, not ripping them out. As women \u2013 and let\u2019s be honest, women are more likely to be booking in for John Lewis bikini waxes than men \u2013 we should aspire to be making things, rather than removing them. To sew your own is an act of creative independence; hair removal and prosecco bars simply fuel the endemic belief that our bodies are flawed and we need \u201cprofessionals\u201d to fix them or drown our sorrows.\nThe idea that shopping and \u201cpampering\u201d are a \u201cleisure day out\u201d as Nickolds claims, is a bare-thighed lie. There is nothing leisurely about disliking your own legs. There is nothing relaxing, luxurious or indulgent about covering your nadgers with hot wax and ripping out the evidence of an adult, mammalian body. I\u2019ve had less painful rock-climbing accidents than the one time I tried to wax the back of my thighs. And at the risk of going full Trotsky on your nether regions, the removal of pubic hair is yet another way that capitalism plays on personal insecurities to make money from your body. And we don\u2019t have to go along with it if we don\u2019t want to.\nOn the other hand, taking on the active, creative, expressive role of maker is genuinely galvanising. In June I went to Berlin for the summer, armed with little more than my sewing machine. Over the next three months I created almost everything I wore with my own hands. There was a dress made from antique soviet linen bought on the corner of Boxhagener Platz, a pair of trousers made from Neuk\u00f6lln cotton, a bridesmaid dress made from a roll of silk found behind a box of potatoes at the T\u00fcrkischer Markt, numerous jumpsuits, shorts, shirts and vests \u2013 all made on my bedroom floor using a machine I inherited from my great-aunt Margaret. Those items weren\u2019t only cheap, didn\u2019t just fit me, didn\u2019t just keep me off the streets for an hour at a time, but will serve as a lifelong reminder of a wonderful trip and the fact that, despite what the fashion industry may tell us, we can all do it ourselves.\nMany of my friends would no doubt be thrilled to their very pudenda at the idea of a John Lewis wax. As leisure activities go, it at least gives money to one of our last employee-owned companies and might be more fun than pole-dancing classes or throwing up sambuca into a sticky bin outside Flares. But my generation needs materials, tools and the confidence to do it themselves, not \u201cme time\u201d, prosecco and plucked genitals.\nWhen tearing out your pubic hair and slapping on grease become genuinely uplifting acts of self-empowerment then sports societies will stop using them as hazing initiation rites. In the meantime, you\u2019ll find me, crouched over my sewing machine, making yet another outfit. For that is my own personal commitment: never knowingly underdressed.\n"},

At present, he said, the UK spent more annually on the winter fuel allowance than on the Foreign Office, while the department\u2019s budget was only twice the UK aid budget to Ethiopia.\n\u201cMy concern is, whatever our ambition and intent, the process of our EU separation will suck our policy and political energy inwards, far more so if it leads to an existential crisis over Scotland or a deterioration of peace and and security in Northern Ireland,\u201d he said. \n\u201cOther countries that had the UK down as a stable and active player in world affairs are unsure at the moment where we are heading.\u201d\nAlthough he insisted Britain could yet retain global influence outside the EU, through other international institutions such as Nato and the UN, Fraser warned there was no point denying that the decision to leave affected how the UK conducted foreign policy.\nTo tackle the problem Fraser urged a revamp of Whitehall departments, saying May had fragmented the international effort, with six different government departments now leading on foreign and security policy.\nHe said the Foreign Office should be handed the same coordinating role over foreign affairs as the Treasury enjoys over economic policy. He suggested the Department of International Development and the Department of International Trade could be incorporated into the Foreign Office.\nHe disclosed Whitehall was facing \u201can uphill struggle\u201d to respond to Brexit and that since there had been no planning for the UK\u2019s withdrawal from the EU, Whitehall was still in the process of analysing options for a future relationship. The Foreign Office in particular was preparing an initiative setting out how the UK could retain close security and foreign policy relations with the EU, even though in future it will be excluded from its meetings and denied access to papers.\nFraser said continued diplomatic and security influence would come with continued economic success, and urged the government not to imagine it would be easy to build a new economic relationship away from the EU. \u201cThat is why a rational outcome on our future relationship with the EU single market is essential,\u201d he said\nFraser also urged the cabinet not to think Britain could build a reliable economic future by engaging only with non-European countries such as China and India. \u201cWe export more to Belgium at the moment than we do to India, Russia Brazil and South Africa combined,\u201d he said. Although UK trade with these countries was growing, the structure of UK trade was not going to shift rapidly. Geographical proximity remained a huge determinant of a country\u2019s trading relationships he said.\nBritain had to acknowledge that its most important international relations would remain those with the United States, Germany and France. \nAnd in pointed advice, possibly to the foreign secretary, Boris Johnson, he said: \u201cA good start would be to listen to those around them that have experience and knowledge of how the EU works, the complex issues they will need to negotiate and what the people on the other side of the table will be thinking.\u201d\n\n"},

Previous studies have found evidence that by helping neurons to fire, these minor brain zaps can boost cognitive ability.\nThe technology is seen as a safer alternative to prescription drugs, such as modafinil and ritalin, both of which have been used off-label as performance enhancing drugs in the armed forces. \nBut while electrical brain stimulation appears to have no harmful side effects, some experts say its long-term safety is unknown, and raise concerns about staff being forced to use the equipment if it is approved for military operations. \nOthers are worried about the broader implications of the science on the general workforce because of the advance of an unregulated technology.\nIn a new report, scientists at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base in Ohio describe how the performance of military personnel can slump soon after they start work if the demands of the job become too intense. \n\u201cWithin the air force, various operations such as remotely piloted and manned aircraft operations require a human operator to monitor and respond to multiple events simultaneously over a long period of time,\u201d they write. \u201cWith the monotonous nature of these tasks, the operator\u2019s performance may decline shortly after their work shift commences.\u201d\nBut in a series of experiments at the air force base, the researchers found that electrical brain stimulation can improve people\u2019s multitasking skills and stave off the drop in performance that comes with information overload. Writing in the journal Frontiers in Human Neuroscience, they say that the technology, known as transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS), has a \u201cprofound effect\u201d.\nFor the study, the scientists had men and women at the base take a test developed by Nasa to assess multitasking skills. The test requires people to keep a crosshair inside a moving circle on a computer screen, while constantly monitoring and responding to three other tasks on the screen. \nTo investigate whether tDCS boosted people\u2019s scores, half of the volunteers had a constant two milliamp current beamed into the brain for the 36-minute-long test. The other half formed a control group and had only 30 seconds of stimulation at the start of the test.\nAccording to the report, the brain stimulation group started to perform better than the control group four minutes into the test. \u201cThe findings provide new evidence that tDCS has the ability to augment and enhance multitasking capability in a human operator,\u201d the researchers write. Larger studies must now look at whether the improvement in performance is real and, if so, how long it lasts.\nThe tests are not the first to claim beneficial effects from electrical brain stimulation. Last year, researchers at the same US facility found that tDCS seemed to work better than caffeine at keeping military target analysts vigilant after long hours at the desk. Brain stimulation has also been tested for its potential to help soldiers spot snipers more quickly in VR training programmes.\nNeil Levy, deputy director of the Oxford Centre for Neuroethics, said that compared with prescription drugs, electrical brain stimulation could actually be a safer way to boost the performance of those in the armed forces. \u201cI have more serious worries about the extent to which participants can give informed consent, and whether they can opt out once it is approved for use,\u201d he said. \u201cEven for those jobs where attention is absolutely critical, you want to be very careful about making it compulsory, or there being a strong social pressure to use it, before we are really sure about its long-term safety.\u201d\nBut while the devices may be safe in the hands of experts, the technology is freely available, because the sale of brain stimulation kits is unregulated. They can be bought on the internet or assembled from simple components, which raises a greater concern, according to Levy. Young people whose brains are still developing may be tempted to experiment with the devices, and try higher currents than those used in laboratories, he says. \u201cIf you use high currents you can damage the brain,\u201d he says.\nIn 2014 another Oxford scientist, Roi Cohen Kadosh, warned that while brain stimulation could improve performance at some tasks, it made people worse at others. In light of the work, Kadosh urged people not to use brain stimulators at home.\nIf the technology is proved safe in the long run though, it could help those who need it most, said Levy. \u201cIt may have a levelling-up effect, because it is cheap and enhancers tend to benefit the people that perform less well,\u201d he said.\n"},

It produced the Chicxulub crater off the coast of Mexico as well as wiping out non-avian dinosaurs and a vast array of other species.\nWhile previous evidence had suggested that the effects of the impact might have been less severe in the southern hemisphere, possibly because it provided a sort of refuge for species, the new research hints at a different explanation. \nThe lesser severity apparently seen in the southern hemisphere could be down to ecosystems recovering more quickly, researchers have found.\n\u201cThis extinction event is very important \u2013 it is a one of the major extinctions in the history of the Earth,\u201d said Michael Donovan of Pennsylvania State University, a co-author of the research published in the journal Nature Ecology & Evolution. \n\u201cThe biodiversity patterns we see today, where things are living, may be related to what survived \u2013 so it is important to learn about what was happening around the world at this time,\u201d he added.\nTo unpick why life in the southern hemisphere appeared to have fared better in the aftermath of the impact than in the north, scientists looked at the effect of the asteroid strike on leaf-eating insects. \u201cWe can learn a lot about what was happening at the base of the ecosystems by looking at what is happening to the plants and insects,\u201d said Donovan.\nThe team, from the USA and Argentina, analysed 3,646 fossil leaves from Patagonia dating from around a million years before the impact to around four million years after the event. The analysis focused on comparing damage produced by the nibbling of insects to that previously seen in fossil leaves from the western interior of North America.\nThe North American leaves revealed that the diversity of damage, and therefore the variety of insects munching on the leaves, decreased dramatically at the time of the asteroid impact, with insects that fed on just a small selection of plants the worst hit. The data also showed that it took around nine million years for insect damage to recover to pre-impact levels. \nSimilar trends were seen in the fossil leaves from Patagonia. However, both before and after the asteroid impact the diversity of damage was higher, suggesting that Patagonia was rich in a huge variety of insects. What\u2019s more, the diversity of the leaf damage returned to pre-impact levels more quickly than in North America, taking just four million years.\nCareful analysis of details in the damage produced by insects that burrow between leaf layers - so-called leaf miners - offered further insights, revealing that even though the same type of insects existed in Patagonia before and after the impact, they were unlikely to be of the same species. \u201cIt makes it look like there is a lower extinction, but ... there\u2019s actually new insects that were making this damage,\u201d said Donovan.\nThe upshot, the authors conclude, is that the catastrophic impact that bumped off the dinosaurs had a huge and devastating effect on insect biodiversity in both hemispheres, but that ecosystems recovered more quickly in Patagonia than in the western interior of North America. Given the crucial role plant-eating insects in food chains it is feasible, Donovan adds, that \u201cquicker recovery may be a general trend\u201d across the southern hemisphere. \nWhile it is not clear why ecosystems recovered faster in Patagonia, Donovan believes one factor could be its greater distance from the site of the asteroid strike, although he adds that is unlikely to be the full story. \nJason Hilton, a palaeobotanist from the University of Birmingham who was not involved in the research, said the work convincingly showed that diversity in the southern hemisphere was as severely affected by the mass extinction 66 million years ago as it was in North America, overturning the idea that the southern hemisphere was a refuge for species. \n\u201cDifferent locations were devastated by the impact event triggering mass extinction but its effects lasted longer in some places than others,\u201d he said.\n"},

Can neuroscientists reveal how he performs such incredible mental feats?", "title": "Inside the brain of the man who would be 'Blindfold King' of chess", "text": "Even by world record standards, it sets a high bar for human performance. Next month in Las Vegas a chess player named Timur Gareyev plans to take on nearly 50 opponents at once. But that is not the hard part. While his challengers will play the games as normal, Gareyev himself will be blindfolded.\nThe 28-year-old already stands out in the rarefied world of blindfold chess. He has a fondness for bright clothes, a hairstyle that morphs from mane to mohican, and he gets his kicks from Base jumping. He has proved himself a contender, too. In a 10-hour chess marathon in 2013, Gareyev played 33 games in his head simultaneously. He won 29 and lost none. The skill has become his brand: he calls himself the Blindfold King.\nBut Gareyev\u2019s prowess has drawn interest from beyond the chess-playing community. In the hope of understanding how he and others like him can perform such mental feats, researchers at the University of California in Los Angeles called him in for memory tests and brain scans. They now have their first results.\n\u201cThe ability to play a game of chess with your eyes closed is not a far reach for most accomplished players,\u201d said Jesse Rissman, who runs a memory lab at UCLA. \u201cBut the thing that\u2019s so remarkable about Timur and a few other individuals is the number of games they can keep active at once. To me it is simply astonishing.\u201d\nGareyev learned to play chess in Tashkent when he was six years old. Tutored by his grandfather, he entered his first tournament aged eight and soon became obsessed with competitions. At 16, he was crowned Asia\u2019s youngest ever chess grandmaster. He moved to the US soon after, where his obsession switched to poker, but as a student he still helped the University of Texas in Brownsville win its first national chess championship. In 2013, Gareyev was ranked the third best chess player in the US.\nTo the uninitiated, blindfold chess seems to call for superhuman skill. But displays of the feat, also known as sans voir, go back centuries. The first recorded game in Europe played out in 13th-century Florence. In 1947, the Argentinian grandmaster Miguel Najdorf played 45 simultaneous games in his mind. He won 39 times in the 24-hour session and was reportedly unable to sleep for three days afterwards. For the Blindfold King\u2019s crown to sit more comfortably, he must beat the record 46 games played at once by the German Marc Lang in 2011.\nAccomplished players can learn to play blind even without realising it. The nature of the game is to run through possible moves in the mind to see how they play out. From this, regular players develop a memory for the patterns the pieces make, the defences and attacks. \u201cYou recreate it in your mind,\u201d said Gareyev. \u2018A lot of players are capable of doing what I\u2019m doing.\u201d\nThe real mental challenge comes from playing multiple games at once in the head. Not only must the positions of each piece on every board be memorised, they must be recalled faithfully when needed, updated with each player\u2019s moves, and then reliably stored again, so the brain can move on to the next board. Gareyev said that to remember each board, he must be focused and deliberate. \u201cIf I skip from one board to another too quickly, when I come back to it, it\u2019s not perfect and at times I\u2019ll mess up.\u201d First moves can be tough to remember because they are often so humdrum: a pawn in front of the king or queen advances two squares. But the end games are taxing too, as exhaustion sets in. When Gareyev is tired, his recall can get patchy. He sometimes makes moves based on only a fragmented memory of the pieces\u2019 positions.\nTo train for the record attempt, Gareyev has been on a chess tour that builds in a hefty schedule of exercise and yoga backed up with healthy eating. Next week, he will play ten games blindfolded at the Society for Neuroscience meeting in San Diego. At the same conference, Rissman\u2019s team will unveil the latest results from their tests on the player.\nThe scientists first had Gareyev perform some standard memory tests. These assessed his ability to hold numbers, pictures and words in mind. One classic test measures how many numbers a person can repeat, both forwards and backwards, soon after hearing them. Most people manage about seven. \u201cHe was not exceptional on any of these standard tests,\u201d said Rissman. \u201cWe didn\u2019t find anything other than playing chess that he seems to be supremely gifted at.\u201d\nBut next came the brain scans. With Gareyev lying down in the machine, Rissman looked at how well connected the various regions of the chess player\u2019s brain were. Though tentative and as yet unpublished, the scans found much greater than average communication between parts of Gareyev\u2019s brain that make up what is called the frontoparietal control network. Of 63 people scanned alongside the chess player, only one or two scored more highly on the measure. \u201cYou use this network in almost any complex task. It helps you to allocate attention, keep rules in mind, and work out whether you should be responding or not,\u201d said Rissman.\nIt was not the only hint of something special in Gareyev\u2019s brain. The scans also suggest that Gareyev\u2019s visual network is more highly connected to other brain parts than usual. If confirmed in further work, the areas of his brain that process visual images - such as chess boards - may have stronger links to other brain regions, and so be more powerful than normal. While the analyses are not finalised yet, they may hold the first clues to Gareyev\u2019s extraordinary ability.\nFor the world record attempt, a blindfolded Gareyev hopes to play 47 games at once in about 16 hours. He will need to win 80% to claim the title. \u201cI don\u2019t worry too much about the winning percentage, that\u2019s never been an issue for me,\u201d he said. \u201cThe most important part of blindfold chess for me is that I have found the one thing that I can fully dedicate myself to. I miss having an obsession.\u201d\n"},
{"tags": ["science"], "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/science/2016/nov/06/placebo-effect-is-there-something-in-it", "abstract": "A study of the sometimes positive effects of taking drug-free pills suggests a biological factor at work", "title": "The placebo effect: is there something in it after all?", "text": "The placebo effect remains one of the most baffling mysteries in medicine. The idea that a useless sugar pill or harmless saline injection could result in a measurable improvement in a patient\u2019s symptoms, sometimes as good as taking an active drug, has been so hard to explain that some have even doubted whether it can be real.\nHowever, there is now evidence showing some people, known as \u201cplacebo responders\u201d, do feel or get better after unwittingly, or even wittingly, taking a placebo \u2013 and it\u2019s not just psychosomatic. Several studies are pointing to a biological basis for the placebo effect, with the latest research focused on a region of the brain known as the mid-frontal gyrus, which runs along the frontal lobes just above the eyes.\nThe study, carried out by Marwan Baliki and Vania Apkarian at Northwestern University in Chicago, involved a small number of chronic-pain patients with osteoarthritis of the knee. It is a rare example of a placebo study based on real patients rather than healthy volunteers who are just exposed to pain-inducing experiments to see how they feel when given a placebo.\nBaliki used an MRI scanner to observe in real time how the brain of patients responded to a placebo \u2013 in this case a sugar pill instead of a painkiller. In short, he found that an area within the mid-frontal gyrus lit up or, in his own words, \u201cshowed a higher functional connectivity\u201d in patients who responded to the placebo, compared with non-responders.\nHe concluded that this brain region seemed to be quite separate from another region of the brain known to be involved in responding to the effects of real painkilling drugs. In other words, Baliki appeared to have found the \u201cseat\u201d of the placebo effect within the brain.\n\u201cIn simple terms, we pinpointed a brain region, a hotspot or seat, that can predict the propensity of a patient\u2019s response to a placebo within the wider patient population suffering from chronic pain,\u201d Baliki says. \u201cWe also examined the specificity of our results by testing whether this hotspot can predict pain analgesia to an active drug. We found that it does not, suggesting that this brain region is specific for placebo analgesia.\u201d\nThe findings suggest a biological basis for the placebo effect and raise the prospect of tests to see if individuals are going to be good placebo responders or not. For those who are responders, it could mean targeting them with placebo pain treatments that might work specifically for them. Or it could result in identifying placebo responders so that they don\u2019t get included in clinical trials, which have long been thought to be compromised by them.\nIt is not, however, the first time that scientists have identified a brain region involved in the placebo effect. In 2007 for instance Jon-Kar Zubieta, now at the University of Utah, suggested that the nucleus accumbens, which lies at the top of the brain stem, plays a role in moderating pain after injections of a placebo composed of harmless saline solution \u2013 at least in healthy volunteers.\nOther researchers, meanwhile, have focused on identifying the genetic basis of the placebo effect. This is based on the idea that certain signalling pathways in the brain, especially those involved in the \u201creward\u201d network, help to mediate the placebo effect. The idea is that these signalling pathways are under genetic control and that some people may be blessed with certain combinations of genes that make them more or less responsive to a placebo effect.\nCertainly, the more that scientists investigate the placebo, the weirder the effect seems to be. One study earlier this year found that taking a placebo for chronic lower back pain can work effectively for some people even when they are told that the treatment is just a \u201cpowerful placebo\u201d.\n\u201cOur data suggests that harnessing placebo effects without deception is possible in the context of a plausible rationale,\u201d explained Claudia Carvalho of the ISPA-Instituto Universitario in Lisbon. She found that this kind of \u201copen\u201d placebo reduced initial pain and disability by about 30%.\nAnother study in 2011 on asthma patients found that placebo inhalers had no effect on increasing lung function. But asthma patients nevertheless reported that they felt significantly better after using a \u201cuseless\u201d inhaler \u2013 a baffling result to say the least.\nBut if this is difficult to explain, then what about the \u201cnoncebo\u201d, the evil twin of the placebo, where a sugar pill actually makes people feel worse because they expect to suffer the side effects they have heard about? If the placebo effect has a genuine biological basis, with a seat in the brain and its own set of genes, then it\u2019s plausible the same is true for the noncebo. If that is found to be the case, things could get really interesting.\n"},

More still build up in the mouth, bladder, liver and other organs.\nWhile chemicals in tobacco smoke have long been known to raise the risk of at least 17 forms of cancer, the precise molecular mechanisms through which they mutate DNA and give rise to tumours in different tissues have never been clear.\n\u201cThis is about running down the root cause of cancers,\u201d said David Phillips, a professor of environmental carcinogenesis at King\u2019s College London and a co-author on the study. \u201cBy identifying the root causes, we gain the sort of knowledge we need to think more seriously about cancer prevention.\u201d\nMore than 70 of the 7,000 chemicals found in tobacco smoke are known to cause cancer. Some damage DNA directly, but others ramp up mutations in more subtle ways, often by disrupting the way cells function. The more mutations a cell acquires, the more likely it is to turn cancerous.\nThe reason why some people can smoke for years without getting cancer, while others develop the disease, is down to the way mutations arise. When a person smokes, the chemicals they inhale create mutations at random points in the genome. Many of these changes will be harmless, but others not so benign. The more smoke a person is exposed to, the greater the chance that the accumulating mutations will hit specific spots in the DNA that turn cells cancerous.\n\u201cYou can really think of it as playing Russian roulette,\u201d said Ludmil Alexandrov, a theoretical biologist at Los Alamos National Lab in New Mexico and the first author of the study. \u201cYou can miss the right genes. But if you smoke you still play the game. It\u2019s a very strong message for people not to start smoking. If you smoke even a little bit you\u2019ll erode the genetic material of most of the cells in your body.\u201d Smoking is the most preventable cause of cancer in the world and accounts for more than 1 in 4 UK cancer deaths.\nWith researchers at the Wellcome Trust\u2019s Sanger Institute near Cambridge and others, Alexandrov analysed the DNA of more than 5,000 cancers. The team then turned to pattern recognition software to tease apart the various mutational signatures found in tumours from smokers versus non-smokers. To find the signatures - the patterns of mutations present in cancer cells - researchers performed the genetic equivalent of recording the chatter at a party and then extracting individual conversations from the hubbub.\nThe scientists spotted more than 20 mutational signatures in 13 types of cancer linked to tobacco smoking. But only five of these were more common in smokers\u2019 tumours. One pattern of mutations, dubbed signature four, was found to be a major driver for lung cancer. It is thought to be caused by benzopyrene, a chemical found in tobacco smoke.\nMore intriguing was how tobacco caused mutations in tissues that are not directly exposed to smoke, such as the bladder, kidneys and pancreas. The study found that chemicals from tobacco smoke found their way to different organs and tissues and then sped up the molecular clocks in the cells. This ramped up the natural rate at which mutations built up in the tissues.\n\u201cWe knew there was direct damage from smoking in the lungs. What we didn\u2019t expect was to see smoking speed up the molecular clocks inside cells,\u201d said Alexandrov, whose study appears in the journal Science. \u201cIn bladder cancer, the only thing that causes the extra mutations in smokers is the speeding up of the clock, and that will be very dependent on the intensity of smoking. For every pack of cigarettes you smoke per year, you accumulate 18 mutations in all of your bladder cells,\u201d he added.\nScientists hope that by understanding how the individual ingredients of tobacco smoke raise the risk of various cancers, they can develop new ways to prevent the disease. The same techniques used in the latest study will now be used to tease apart how alcohol, obesity and other factors also increase a person\u2019s cancer risk.\n\u201cThere is a message here for people who are occasional or social smokers who think it doesn\u2019t do anything,\u201d said Alexandrov. \u201cIf you smoke four to five packs of cigarettes in your lifetime it doesn\u2019t sound that much, but you still get several mutations in every cell in your lungs and these are permanent, they do not go away. There are a lot of things that do revert back when you stop smoking, and this shouldn\u2019t discourage people from giving up, but the specific mutations in the lung cells are like scars. If you stop smoking, they\u2019ll still be there.\u201d\n"},

Bolton paid SEM a \u00a3300,000 fee for doing \u201clittle or nothing,\u201d the judgment stated. Lee and Frank McParland, Bolton\u2019s then general manager, were found to have lied about two meetings they claimed had taken place with McCann in a restaurant in Liverpool, designed to show that they had discussed McCann with SEM earlier than they did.\nHis honour Judge Waksman QC, in his 2014 judgment, said he did not accept that any such meetings took place and stated of Lee\u2019s, Bolton\u2019s and SEM\u2019s evidence: \u201cTheir accounts do not stack up and are riddled with inconsistencies and different versions over time.\u201d\nIn a later ruling on legal costs Waksman recorded that Lee\u2019s and McParland\u2019s evidence about the meetings was \u201cunreliable\u201d and \u201cfalse\u201d, saying: \u201cThe events attested to by the Bolton witnesses concerning these meetings simply did not happen. True, I did not use the word \u2018dishonesty\u2019 [in his first judgment] but plainly, if their evidence on the facts on this issue was false, they must have known it to be so.\u201d\nWaksman also found that Bolton, then chaired by the late Phil Gartside, an FA board member, backdated the contract signed by McCann, to make it look as if SEM had been involved earlier than they were. The judge found that Gartside\u2019s evidence was also unreliable and said he \u201cbecame visibly uncomfortable\u201d under questioning about the contract, before finally admitting that he signed it at a later date than the one written on the contract.\nBolton and SEM presented their commercial relationship as if SEM had acted for the club and not McCann, who was said to have resented paying tax when an agent\u2019s fee was paid on his behalf by a club. This practice, of stating that an agent was acting for a club and not a player, was known as \u201cswitching.\u201d Bolton, though, did record the \u00a3300,000 fee paid to SEM as a benefit for McCann anyway, the court was told, because Her Majesty\u2019s Revenue and Customs were conducting \u201can increasing number of investigations\u201d into football transfers.\nWaksman found that when McCann called McGill to tell him SEM were going to do the deal with Bolton, McGill had said: \u201cDon\u2019t do this, Gavin, we have an agreement, what about that?\u201d McCann had replied: \u201cI am sorry, I feel shit\u201d.\nMcGill complained first to the Football Association in 2007, even before McCann signed for Bolton, that SEM had poached McCann from him, in breach of an oral agreement they had made for McGill to represent the player, but the FA took no action and he began court proceedings. Despite Waksman\u2019s findings of poaching, false evidence given by several senior football figures including Sammy Lee and the backdating of the contract, the FA still took no action in 2014. Waksman ruled that despite his findings about the conduct of the Bolton and SEM defendants, McGill could not in fact receive any damages, because he did not have a written agreement with McCann so could not prove he definitely would have ultimately concluded the Bolton deal for him.\nMcGill appealed, and two court of appeal judges have now ruled that in fact he was the victim of an \u201cunlawful means conspiracy\u201d and should be entitled to damages for having lost the opportunity to conclude the deal for McCann to sign for Bolton. That issue, of how much damages McGill is entitled to from SEM, has been referred back to Waksman to be decided.\nThe appeal court judges, Lord Justice Lloyd Jones and Mr Justice Henderson, upheld all the factual findings made by Waksman in his 2014 judgment, noting that although he did not grant McGill\u2019s claim for damages: \u201cThe judge was very critical, however, of much of the evidence given by the defendants and their witnesses, and he concluded that they had fabricated some key events in a misguided attempt to improve their position.\u201d\nMcGill, who has spent nine years fighting to prove his case, told the Guardian that he informed the FA in May 2007 just after McCann was poached away from him, and had always kept the governing body informed.\n\u201cThey now know Bolton submitted a false and backdated contract, that Sammy Lee and Frank McParland gave evidence in court the judge dismissed as untrue, but the FA have done nothing,\u201d he said.\nLee, the former Liverpool and England midfielder, left Bolton in October 2007, then worked in senior coaching roles at Liverpool, back at Bolton and Southampton, before the FA appointed him to rejoin Allardyce, as the England team\u2019s assistant manager, in July this year.\nAfter Allardyce, after taking charge of just one game, left by mutual consent following the undercover sting by the Daily Telegraph last month, Lee has been retained, and is currently working with the squad preparing for the forthcoming matches against Scotland and Spain.\nAsked if following the appeal the FA would now be taking action against Lee or any of the other defendants in the McGill case, a spokesperson said: \u201cWe understand there are still matters to be decided by the court and therefore it would not be appropriate to comment\u201d.\n"},

It\u2019s San Marino versus the world champions.\nCould be messy. It\u2019s a proper mismatch. Germany are the toughest opponents Europe\u2019s most-loved minnows have faced for a while and the two times they\u2019ve met before, a decade ago, ended 6-0 and 13-0. On the other hand, San Marino are on a high of their own after a landmark moment last month.\nThey won? No, but they scored an away goal in a qualifier against Norway. They still lost 4-1, but it was a special moment for the 201st-ranked side \u2013 Mattia Stefanelli equalised, sparking wild celebrations, and provoking an instant viral clip of the reaction in the Norwegian broadcaster\u2019s studio. It was San Marino\u2019s first away goal in World Cup qualifying in 15 years. The icing on the cake: Stefanelli won CNN\u2019s goal of the week competition.\nIsn\u2019t all this a bit patronising? Yes, but the team and the fans rise above it and they boast one of the most entertaining unofficial official Twitter feeds in international football. @Soccersanmarino reacted to their goal in Norway with: \u201cWE [EFFING] SCORED AN AWAY GOAL. STEFANELLI YOU [EFFING] LEGEND!\u201d \u2013 a message that retweeted more than 37,000 times. The writer later reflected: \u201cI have more retweets on this tweet than there are inhabitants in San Marino. Madness.\u201d\nBut even with all that positivity, Friday will be a cakewalk for the visitors? Surely. Then again, England thought the same when they went there in 1993, and they conceded after 8.3 seconds. It made for a classic piece of high-pitched breathless commentary from Jonathan Pearce, who was covering it for London\u2019s Capital Gold radio: \u201cWelcome to Bologna on Capital Gold Sport for England versus San Marino with Tennent\u2019s Pilsner brewed with Czechoslovakian yeast for that extra Pilsner taste and England are one down.\u201d\nGermany would never let that happen\u2026 Seems unlikely.

But it was still good enough to beat Ding, who ultimately had to be content with becoming the first Asian player to reach the final.\nSelby went into the second day of the final leading 10-7. Ding was the perkier, more confident player at the start and won the first two frames. But the opening session was shared 4-4.\nWhen Selby won the first two frames of the final session to go 16-11 up it looked all over. But then Ding won three in a row, the last with a break of 103, to make it 16-14. But that was to be Ding\u2019s last success. Selby won the scrappy next frame before taking the title with a break of 74.\nHe said: \u201cIt\u2019s fantastic. It was very special to win it two years ago but I felt under a lot more pressure now than I did then. I don\u2019t know which is the bigger shock, me winning this or Leicester City winning the Premier League. I\u2019m so proud of Claudio and the boys. We\u2019re only a small place.\n\u201cIt was a tough final and with the amount of pressure Ding is under, from China alone, but to play like that \u2013 I can\u2019t imagine how he could do that.\n\u201cIn the first to 18 a 6-0 lead is not a huge one, especially against someone like Ding. He played fantastically earlier today and I had to just hang on to him. I\u2019m just over the moon. I saved my best performance for the final and I only had two good sessions in the tournament. Luckily my \u2018B\u2019 game is pretty good.\u201d\nRob Walker, snooker\u2019s wonderfully energetic and comic MC, who appears to have walked straight off the pages of the Pickwick Papers, has nicknames for all the players.\nSome work well, others less so. But when Walker introduces Selby as \u201cThe Jester from Leicester\u201d it is as if his humour has taken a decidedly ironic turn. Steve Davis was closer to the mark when, referring to Selby\u2019s Sunday evening vigil, he described him as \u201cthe night porter from hell\u201d. Selby is also, according to his old mentor Willie Thorne, \u201cthe most dedicated snooker player I have ever seen\u201d.\nThere is a rare determination about him, which is hardy surprising in view of the fact his mother walked out of the family home when he was only eight. He and his brother were brought up unaided by their father, who died when Mark was 16.\nThe influence of Ding\u2019s father was hardly any less relevant. When he was eight years old he took \u201cLittle Ding\u201d with him to a local snooker hall and, when his father went to the toilet, he returned to find his baby-faced son had taken over his cue and won the match for him.\nWhile another memorable final was being played out, the World Snooker chairman, Barry Hearn, celebrated a \u201cboom time for the sport\u201d, announcing a two-year extension to the sport\u2019s contract with the BBC, which will run until 2019, while announcing the world championship will remain in Sheffield until 2027.\nHearn said: \u201cThe BBC have gone the extra mile for us. They have had their licence fee frozen by HM Government. It\u2019s cut their arms off, in terms of competing with the pay broadcasters, but compete they did.\n\u201cThe BBC are struggling financially. But they have really got behind snooker. We have had 20 extra hours of additional coverage this year. That\u2019s good because it shows that once they have bought something they really make the most of it, instead of hiding it in the schedules. Now I can\u2019t wait to see the numbers coming in from China.\u201d\nIt was another memorable final \u2013 particularly when the form of these players this season is considered. Ding, ranked 17, had to qualify for this championship.\n"},

The branded Dash buttons are Amazon\u2019s latest offering to make it easier to shop, so I bought a load of them to find out whether it\u2019s the retail revolution we didn\u2019t even know we were looking for.\nThere is no Dash button for ordering Dash buttons, so I looked though the 40 or so available and found eight for things I would normally buy. They\u2019re \u00a35 each, so I spent \u00a340 for this convenience, but with the promise \u00a35 would be taken off the first purchase made with each button making them free in the long run.\nA box of boxes turned up the next day. Each Dash button comes in a small cardboard box. Unpacking them and setting them up was straightforward if a little tedious. For each one you have to do a little song and dance with the Amazon app.\nSelect the option to set up a new Dash, tell it the password to your Wi-Fi network, select the product and quantity and then hit save. The delivery and payment information is pulled from your Amazon one-click order settings; there\u2019s no way to set per-item delivery locations.\nIt doesn\u2019t take too long to set one up, but doing eight in one go got old really fast. Once activated though, that\u2019s you done. In future all you have to do is hit the button \u2013 although that proved to be too easy.\nThankfully when you have pushed the button you get until evening that day to cancel the order. When you\u2019ve made an order a notification pops up from the Amazon app on the device you set up the Dash buttons with, but you can and probably should activate that notification on every device you own.\nThe first time the notification saved my bacon was when I installed the Dash buttons. They come with a sticky strip on the back and a small black hanging bracket that you can attach to a hook or similar. I chose to stick them in place out the way, next to where I\u2019d normally store whatever it was. In the bathroom cabinet for toothbrush heads and Listerine, under the sink for bin bags, cleaning fluid, that kind of thing.\nBy the time I\u2019d managed to stick them in place I\u2019d already ordered a set of new toothbrush heads by accident, and very nearly some toilet roll and washing tablets, none of which I needed. A couple of taps in the app and the order was cancelled.\nI felt good about the installation. They were stuck out the way, inconspicuous and convenient and everything was fine. That was, until they started ordering stuff on their own. It turns out that the adhesive on the back of the Dash buttons doesn\u2019t like sticking to unpainted MDF surfaces within cupboards.\nThe one I had stuck next to the stocks of shower gel, moisturiser and other bits fell off almost immediately within the cupboard, landing as it fell to the shelf surface below on an upstanding bottle of nail varnish ordering some foundation in the process. The first I knew of it was an order notification.\nPresuming it was my fault I simply stuck it back in place with a bit more gusto, which lasted for about an hour before another ping and another tube of foundation to be cancelled. This was starting to get tedious.\nThe Rimmel button was just the start of a trend. Over the next few days all but two of the buttons dropped off various metal, paint and wooden surfaces, some ordering products, others just making a nasty clang in the middle of the night and waking me up.\nIn the end I took the nuclear option and stripped the adhesive gel off the back of the Dash buttons, which doesn\u2019t take long if you pull hard enough, and replaced them with poster mounting strips, which did the trick.\nOnce finally, safely attached to the walls it was a couple of weeks before I actually pushed any of the buttons on purpose. Then the toilet roll and mouthwash began to run out, so it was finally time to put them into action.\nPressing the button was simple. Getting the delivery, however, was not. The trouble is that when setting up the toilet roll button the only option was for an order of 45 rolls. Normally I\u2019d buy eight at a time; our family doesn\u2019t go through toilet paper that quickly.\nIn order to receive a package the size of 45 rolls I had to order it the day before I knew I would be at home to receive it. So I got up on Friday morning, hit both the Andrex and Listerine buttons and gleefully waited for them arrive on Saturday, my very first internet of things purchases.\nThat\u2019s when the second round of trouble started. When I hit the button we were down to three rolls. But while the 1L of mouthwash arrived on Saturday as expected \u2013 in a big box, of course \u2013 the toilet roll did not. By Sunday morning with two toilet rolls left, the order was still \u201cpreparing for dispatch\u201d so I hit cancel, consoling myself that at least Tesco would provide.\nUnfortunately Amazon said I couldn\u2019t cancel because it was already on its way, but on Monday it was still \u201cdispatching\u201d, so I tried cancelling again, to no avail. By Monday evening we were already a good chunk into our last toilet roll, with visions of having to resort to kitchen roll or yesterday\u2019s Guardian. To make matters worse I was off on holiday on Wednesday and was starting to have visions of 45 toilet rolls stuck outside my front door like a giant advert to burglars.\nThankfully it arrived sometime on Tuesday. I came home to find it wedged behind a bin \u2013 luckily it didn\u2019t rain \u2013 meaning we\u2019ll be stocked until February at least. It was not the best first order experience. Subsequent orders for toothbrush heads, Dettol, dishwasher tablets were less painful, primarily because I got most of them delivered when one of the family was home for some other reason. But it certainly wasn\u2019t a case of simply hit it and forget it. \nYou can get deliveries sent to an Amazon locker if there are any within striking distance, but not everything can fit in one - there\u2019s no way the toilet rolls would have. And by the time you\u2019ve gone out to a locker to pick up some Listerine you might just as well have gone to the supermarket. \nWashing tablets, like toilet roll, presented a scale problem. While the tablets arrived on time, they arrived in serious quantity: 180 tabs across six boxes, which at a rate of about one or two a week, is going to last me at least 18 months and feels like I\u2019ve turned my house into a warehouse full of them. The Rimmel button, for a product that would fit through the letter box, has still never been intentionally pressed.\nAmazon pitched the Dash buttons as a way of avoiding the need to fill up your house with large stocks of the boring things in life, but when the order quantities are vast, the next day delivery fails or you simply don\u2019t have someone there everyday to receive deliveries, they\u2019re more trouble than they\u2019re worth.\nPerhaps if you\u2019re part of the metropolitan elite and your serviced apartment comes with a concierge, or you work from home or someone is always in, the brain-free push of the Dash button is a great idea. But the convenience of pushing a button is outweighed by the hassle for me.\nI\u2019ll be keeping some of them for smaller items - they are great for toothbrush heads and bin liners \u2013 and getting them delivered to work but the Andrex button and any others for heavy goods are going: it\u2019s just easier to go to a supermarket and pick them up, or order them in a big weekly online grocery shop.\nThe novelty of Amazon dash buttons wore off even faster than the adhesive backing. \n"},

He received an emoji-less reply: \u201cIt\u2019s fine.\u201d\n\u201cWe all know that\u2019s not what it means at all. That means \u2018it\u2019s not fine\u2019,\u201d he said, pointing out that emoji have infiltrated language so deeply that their absence from that message carries a meaning that we all understand. Once considered a nerd topic, emoji have now become a mainstream medium, Burge says \u2013 and San Francisco\u2019s first Emojicon conference seems to agree.\nHundreds of adults (and surprisingly few children) turned up for sessions including Emoji Karaoke, where participants had to translate the lyrics of pop songs such as Call Me Maybe into strings of emoji; emoji spellcasting, which revealed how modern witches have embraced technology; and a specialist emoji balloon artist whose biggest request was the poop symbol. There was even a stall selling Emojibator, a vibrator in the shape of the aubergine/eggplant emoji. Something for everyone.\nEmoji users feel a significant ownership over these tiny digital symbols, as evidenced by the reaction when Apple swapped the gun emoji for a water pistol and changed the peach emoji to look less like a butt, or when a Saudi teen designed her own headscarf-wearing emoji.\nEmoji have also been recognized as art, with New York\u2019s Museum of Mordern Art (MoMA) acquiring the original 176 emoji designed by a Japanese phone company in 1999. Not everyone agrees with putting emoji on this lofty cultural pedestal, said Paul Galloway, MoMA\u2019s architecture and design collection specialist, but there was similar pushback when MoMA introduced photography, cubist artworks and video games to its collection. \n\u201cPeople think we should be sticking to beautiful oil paintings by dead European guys, but this is part of a broader range of creativity,\u201d he said.\nYet there are more serious cultural problems highlighted by the rise of emoji, particularly how to make them more inclusive to people of different races, genders and physical abilities. Until a range of skintones were introduced for emoji in 2015, there were no options for making emoji anything other than white (or cartoon yellow) \u2013 and even the new set of modifiers were only introduced after public outrage about lack of diversity.\nResearcher Kate Miltner has spent two years researching why emoji were developed with such a limited worldview. She concluded that there was no intention to actively exclude people, but that the icons did align with a belief that inadvertently marginalizes people \u2013 the belief that technology is neutral.\n\u201cEmoji may seem trivial, just silly little faces, but when you aren\u2019t represented by something that\u2019s so widely used, it\u2019s a problem. The values either intentionally \u2013 or unintentionally \u2013 baked into the systems we use on a daily basis can deeply impact people and how they navigate their world,\u201d said Miltner, a PhD student at USC Annenberg School of Communication and Journalism, who conducted extensive interviews with, and analyzed hundreds of emails from, the Unicode Consortium, the official body which standardizes emoji.\nBoth Unicode and its partner, the International Organization for Standardization, approached their task as a technical process, Miltner said, to encode the characters originally created by Japanese telecoms firms and avoid \u201cthe messy politics of representation\u201d. Yet there is no such thing as a neutral or apolitical technological system.\n\u201cDesign and engineering choices are made by people \u2013 people who have belief systems, who work for organizations that have belief systems, and who direct their products to a market or a set of consumers who have certain belief systems,\u201d said Miltner. \u201cThis is not necessarily bad \u2013 it\u2019s just how things are.\u201d\n\u201cInvesting in the idea that technology is neutral ignores and even erases the influence of engineers, designers and the organizations they work for. When this happens, it often works out that marginalized groups \u2013 people of color, LGBTQIA folks, differently abled people \u2013 are not taken into consideration because they are not considered to be the default, or the norm.\u201d\nThe author Toni Morrison once said: \u201cIn this country, \u2018American\u2019 means white. Everybody else has to hyphenate.\u201d Hosiery, clothing and bandages sold as \u201cskin tone\u201d are typically the colour of white skin, Miltner said, because whiteness is considered the default skin in the western world. The same happens with gender and sexual orientation; until 2015 the family emoji represented a heterosexual, white-skinned couple with two children. \u201cWhen people say default or standard that usually means western, white and usually male,\u201d she said.\nMiltner says we need to think beyond binary interpretations of gender and race, especially in technologies that \u2013 however \u201ccute\u201d or \u201csilly\u201d \u2013 are used by millions of people worldwide. \n\u201cIt behooves us all to acknowledge the power and politics that are involved in the formation of widely used technologies, especially if we are to move beyond the \u2018default\u2019 and towards more inclusivity.\u201d\n"},

It offers an apology for falling short on the company\u2019s ambition to \u201coffer best-in-class safety and quality.\n\u201cWe will re-examine every aspect of the device, including all hardware, software, manufacturing and the overall battery structure,\u201d Lee wrote. \u201cWe will move as quickly as possible, but will take the time needed to get the right answers.\u201d\nThe apology focuses on the Note 7, which was supposed to be Samsung\u2019s flagship extra-large phone until it was revealed that it had a dangerous tendency to overheat and catch fire.\nBut it also covers Samsung\u2019s other ongoing PR nightmare: the revelation that some of the company\u2019s top-loading washing machines are capable of vibrating themselves to pieces, in one case breaking a customer\u2019s jaw. The company has instituted a voluntary recall to address the issue and is offering free in-home repair and rebates for owners. \u201cOur service teams are visiting homes this week to help resolve concerns,\u201d Lee added.\nMeanwhile, in New Zealand, the Note 7\u2019s recall is almost complete, but some customers are refusing to give up their phones, hoping that the risk of fire is worth it to keep what is otherwise a well-respected phone. As a result, New Zealand\u2019s mobile networks are teaming up with Samsung to disconnect the device from their networks entirely.\nFrom 18 November, the Note 7 will no longer work on any mobile carrier in the country. \u201cNumerous attempts by all providers have been made to contact owners and ask them to bring the phones in for replacement or refund.

We even contacted Google\u2019s president of EMEA strategic relationships, but received no response nor improvement.\u201d\nThe result of the collapse was ProtonMail\u2019s growth rate dropping by a quarter for the affected months, something the company estimates cost it \u201cseveral hundred thousand Swiss Francs\u201d. In the end, it tried going semi-public, sending tweets to Google directly accusing the company of \u201cintentionally hiding ProtonMail from search results\u201d.\nThat seemed to work, sparking a reply from Google\u2019s then-head of webspam, Matt Cutts.\n\u201cAfter a few days,\u201d ProtonMail writes, \u201cGoogle informed us that they had \u2018fixed something\u2019 without providing further details. The results could be immediately seen.\u201d The company\u2019s site returned to the first page of results, where it has stayed ever since.\nOne potential cause of the collapse in ranking could be ProtonMail\u2019s site moving domains, from protonmail.ch to protonmail.com. Such transfers can cause the collected authority attributed to the site to be lost, forcing site owners to start afresh. But regardless of the cause, ProtonMail argues that the event demonstrated the existence of \u201csearch risk\u201d.\n\u201cThe danger is that any service such as ProtonMail can easily be suppressed by either search companies, or the governments that control those search companies,\u201d it writes. \u201cThis can happen even across national borders.

In between precision shots from his Ghostbusters-like energy weapon, he grapples on to a grunt and pulls the pin on his grenade before kicking him towards two buddies, who look on helplessly as he greets them with an explosion. That taken care of, Reyes grapples to his waiting Jackal space fighter and boosts off to begin dogfighting with enemy craft. \nNeedless to say, Call of Duty\u2019s production values ensure such episodes look spectacular. They may not be perfect in execution \u2013 rotation can become disorientating and enemy AI remains erratic \u2013 but they at least attempt to jolt this long-running series off its sometimes derided rails. Disappointingly though, Infinity Ward\u2019s latest offering is mostly the familiar CoD routine of boots-on-the-ground combat in long corridors of choreographed action. It\u2019s just that here, those boots are rocket-boosted and wall-run-capable. Even this concept is a pale imitation of Titanfall at its finest, boasting similar fundamentals but not the conviction to make them integral. While traversing these familiar sci-fi environments \u2013 futuristic cityscape, ice planet, rock planet, space station \u2013 parkour is mostly unnecessary.\nThe old problem of this game\u2019s key narrative delivery technique remains: you have to follow computer-controlled characters who yell orders and exposition at you, but often they move too slow and it gets frustrating \u2013 like attempting to navigate Oxford Street on a particularly chaotic festive shopping day. The sheer number of times the game strips control away from you remains extraordinary \u2013 after a while, even the most impressive cinematic moments become a deadening intrusion. The first time you\u2019re blasted out of an airlock it\u2019s inarguably impressive and it even feels appropriate that you\u2019re helpless. The second time is simply irritating. The third time, you just want to drift away forever like Frank Poole in 2001: A Space Odyssey. \nBut even in space, you lack freedom. Attempts to flank the enemy are thwarted by a curt prompt to return to the \u201ccombat zone\u201d or be booted. The space craft combat sequences are a mess. The physics lack heft and movement feels erratic. Opposing fighters are simple to lock on to but the game then wrests control away to track them. Occasionally, when you kill an enemy, a playing card will pop up to tell you he was a big cheese (in an imitation of the American ploy towards rogue Ba\u2019athists in 2003), but since you only find this out after killing them it renders the whole scheme somewhat pointless. You shot them just the same as all the others; that\u2019s all you do in CoD.\nMuch is made of the fact you\u2019re a captain but you can\u2019t issue orders in the field and, despite a Mass Effect-like galaxy map to navigate on your ship\u2019s bridge, you cannot shape the campaign\u2019s outcome. You can select two types of side-mission \u2013 ship-infiltration or ship-to-ship combat \u2013 but the benefit of them is merely upgraded equipment. It\u2019s certainly no Mass Effect in this respect \u2013 and while that comparison is harsh, it\u2019s conditioned by the developer\u2019s flagrant desire for you to care about your mission and crew; the message about prioritising one over the other crowbarred into every conversation.\nThe setting at least allows the game to sidestep CoD\u2019s traditionally problematic politics, even if the opening sneak-attack on Geneva subtly nods towards Pearl Harbour and 9/11. Not being offensive shouldn\u2019t be praiseworthy, however, and the Martian secessionists led by Salen Kotch (a space-scenery-chewing Kit Harington) are so comically evil, and your means for defeating them so silly, they undermine any questions about military service the game attempts to tackle.\nThe defeat of the villain is woefully anticlimactic, whereas the finale has dramatic deaths for minor crew members you\u2019d barely noticed hitherto. While the credits roll you can listen to letters from the fallen, meant to sum up the series\u2019 earnest move away from \u201cpress x to show respects\u201d miss-steps. Instead, they bring to mind the deliberately ridiculous barbecue dream of BJ Blazkowicz in the last Wolfenstein. The characters here lack the script to justify you caring. The damning irony is only wisecracking robot Ethan sounds remotely human.\nFor all these flaws, CoD\u2019s core shooting mechanics, refined over countless iterations, still make for a fine corridor and multiplayer shooter. Every weapon comes with alternative fire modes and being creative in your kills is part of the appeal. Innovations such as anti-grav grenades and spider bots (which scuttle over to enemies before discharging) spice things up, not least when they\u2019re deployed against you. One of the most enjoyable new tactics in the campaign is the ability to take direct control of enemy bots by hacking them, unleashing rounds on their bewildered allies before detonating to take as many with you as you can.\nAfter completing the game, you can replay the whole thing in modes like Yolo, which offers a challenging permadeath mechanic that encourages a whole different approach (ie a lot of hiding).\nThe online multiplayer modes are the best thing. The campaign\u2019s traversal mechanics come out of hiding and the wealth of options become apparent. Whether you\u2019re angling for nuts and bolts deathmatch on a lunch break, or something more substantial, CoD remains a silly, slick and intuitive shooter that sucks you in and keeps you there. The ready-built combat rigs cater to different play styles so you can instantly pick the right loadout, whether you like to snipe or stab.\nFor the first time there\u2019s weapon crafting, too, and a conscious effort to reward players for attempting different match-types, not to mention a neat 1980s theme park reboot of zombie survival. Prototype weapons are the strongest in the game \u2013 graded common to epic \u2013 and you obtain them by earning salvage as you play or completing challenges with one of four mission teams. The holy grail is a gun that provides a nuclear blast if you can string together 25 kills.\nCrucially, such objectives are optional and there\u2019s no chance of the camera being yanked-away as you complete them. Infinite Warfare improves online because the game doesn\u2019t dictate your experiences precisely as the developers intended. In many ways the campaign feels like a wrestling match between your game and theirs, perhaps a mirroring of their attempt to innovate within the constraints of the CoD franchise behemoth. But this doesn\u2019t excuse a forgettable plot or inferior fighting to its triple-A peers. Infinite Warfare could have been much more than a passable single-player movie attached to a super fast, super confident multiplayer infrastructure. As such, and with those moments of tantalising potential in mind, it feels like a wasted opportunity.\nActivision; PC/PS4/Xbox One (version tested); \u00a350; Pegi rating: 18+\n"},

One customer described the new bar as looking \u201clike a weird knock-off of itself\u201d.\nExplaining the change, the statement on Toblerone\u2019s Facebook page said: \u201cLike many other companies, we are experiencing higher costs for numerous ingredients. \n\u201cWe carry these costs for as long as possible, but to ensure Toblerone remains \u2026 affordable and retains the triangular shape, we have had to reduce the weight of just two of our bars in the UK, from the wider range of available Toblerone products.\u201d\nCustomers replying to the post have been scathing. Richard Cristiano Tamerighi wrote: \u201c[It\u2019s] just plain dumb changing the trademark shape of your flagship product. If you were really that concerned about Toblerone customers you would have consulted them.\u201d\nMicha\u0142 Tat wrote: \u201cThis must be up there with the dumbest corporate decisions of all time.

Looks stupid imo [in my opinion], could have just made the bar shorter and kept the original design.\u201d\nFormer Labour deputy prime minister John Prescott suggested the change was related to the Brexit vote. He tweeted:\nA spokeswoman for Mondel\u0113z International, the US food and drink corporation that owns the Toblerone brand, said the price rise was not related to Brexit. However, it comes after a number of companies sought to raise prices to offset the effect of a plunging pound since the vote to leave the EU. \nOn Sunday, it emerged that Birds Eye fish fingers and Walkers crisps had joined Typhoo and Unilever, the owner of Marmite, and a number of smaller suppliers in an industry-wide battle over price increases caused by the 14.5% drop in the value of the pound against the euro and 18% against the dollar since the referendum.\nToblerone was created in 1908 by Theodor Tobler, a second-generation chocolatier from Bern, Switzerland, in collaboration with his cousin Emil Baumann. Its name is a portmanteau of the creator\u2019s surname and \u201ctorrone\u201d, the Italian word for honey and almond nougat. \nToblerone\u2019s own website proudly tells how the following year it became the first milk chocolate bar with almonds and honey to be protected by intellectual property laws after Tobler successfully applied for a patent to cover its manufacturing process. \nWhile many believe that the bar\u2019s shape is meant to evoke the Swiss Alps, a belief no doubt perpetuated by the image of the Matterhorn on its packaging, this is said to be a myth. Years later, Tobler\u2019s sons claimed that their father got his inspiration from the dancers of Paris\u2019s Folies Berg\u00e8res, who formed a pyramid at the climax of their show. \n"},

Some of our customers went through what was a traumatic and painful experience as a result of the crisis. I am very sorry that we did not provide the level of service and understanding we should have done.\u201d\nA review is under way into whether bonuses should be withheld from former and current staff involved in the bank\u2019s now now-defunct global restructuring group (GRG), which is at the heart of the complaints.\nThe allegations first surfaced in 2013 when Lawrence Tomlinson, a businessman who was an adviser to the then business secretary, Sir Vince Cable, compiled a dossier alleging the bank deliberately wrecked small businesses to make profits.\nSome 12,000 small businesses were forced into GRG but only 4,000 will automatically receive a refund of \u201ccomplex\u201d fee. In total, some 8,000 were potentially viable when they entered GRG, while 4,000 were facing insolvency.\nConfirmation of the compensation plans \u2013 details of which began to emerge on Monday \u2013 immediately sparked concerns that the sum being aside by the 73% taxpayer-owned bank was inadequate. \n\u201cGiven the damage to the lives of RBS\u2019s customers, \u00a3400m is wholly inadequate and is a cynical attempt to evade accounting fully for the consequences of RBS GRG\u2019s action.

But it also concluded that there was evidence of systemically poor treatment of small business customers.\nBailey signalled that further delays to the report \u2013 commissioned from legal experts Promontory and Mazars \u2013 were likely as it would have to undergo Maxwellisation, where anyone facing criticism is allowed to comment, before publication. \nThe FCA also cautioned that the activities carried out by GRG were largely unregulated. \u201cTherefore, the FCA\u2019s powers are limited in this area,\u201d the FCA said. However, it does not necessarily indicate the bank will escape financial sanction as the regulator said it was \u201ccurrently assessing what further work may be needed given the findings in the report\u201d.\nMcEwan has repeatedly defended the bank against claims that it deliberately tried to profit from small business customers and RBS repeated on Tuesday that it had lost more than \u00a32bn in lending to small businesses.\nHe said the situation could not be tackled until now \u2013 even though a report commissioned from Clifford Chance in 2014 had highlighted the issues of poorly structured fees \u2013 because the FCA review had been continuing.\nPromontory examined 207 cases and covered a six-year period, analysing 323 gigabytes of data \u2013 approximately 1.5m pages and 270,000 emails.\n"},

Currently two-thirds of its floor space is given over to racks of clothing and homewares. \nRowe, who began his retail career aged 15 as a Saturday boy at M&S\u2019s Croydon store in south London and took over as chief executive six months ago, insisted the decision to close stores and reduce the space given over to clothing was not an admission of defeat.\n\u201cThis is not about cutting jobs, it\u2019s about making sure we\u2019ve got the right estate for future shopping habits,\u201d he said. \nEarlier this year, he announced 500 job cuts at the group\u2019s head office in London and a plan to shift another 400 jobs out of the capital.\nThe M&S veteran is seeking to revive the fortunes of the 132-year-old retailer which has seen profits go backwards in recent years. His biggest job is stopping the rot in its clothing business which has now in its fifth consecutive year of falling sales. M&S believes the growth of online fashion shopping means it can devote more store space to food without losing sales. About 17% of M&S\u2019s clothing sales are currently made online, a figure that is expected to grow.\nRowe is also axing the chain\u2019s Indigo, Collezione and North Coast labels to focus on brands that are \u201cmost relevant to our customers\u201d including Autograph, Per Una and Blue Harbour.\n\u201cThese are tough decisions, but vital to building a future M&S that is simpler, more relevant, multichannel and focused on delivering sustainable returns,\u201d said Rowe.\nThe plan was not well received by investors; shares finished the day as the biggest faller in the FTSE 100 \u2013 down more than 5% as analysts complained that Rowe\u2019s plan to revive M&S was not radical enough. \u201cBeing such a large company, it is going to take some time to turn M&S round even if all goes according to plan,\u201d said Haitong analyst Tony Shiret. \u201cWe think that it should have gone further in its UK clothing space closure.\u201d\nM&S\u2019s decision to retreat from the high street will be a blow for some towns, where it is a main destination store, especially following the demise of BHS. But as more purchases are made online, stores in smaller or less attractive town centres and shopping centres are finding life difficult.\n\u201cThe closure of the local M&S will have a psychological effect and feel like another nail in the coffin for that town\u2019s high street,\u201d said Local Data Company analyst Matthew Hopkinson. Hopkinson points to places such as Swindon and Stockton-on-Tees where shoppers have been drawn away from the high street by out-of-town retail parks.\nM&S has been battered by low-cost rivals such as H&M, Zara and Primark and shoppers are increasingly spending their spare cash on leisure activities, rather than buying new clothes. The turnaround plan was unveiled as the retailer reported a 19% fall in underlying profits to \u00a3231m in the six months to 1 October.\nTo win back shoppers, Rowe has already cut clothing prices and promised to pay more attention to its most loyal group of shoppers \u2013 fiftysomething women he has dubbed \u201cMrs M&S\u201d. He said changes he had already made in the clothing business were going down well. \u201cThe initial feedback we\u2019ve had from customers has been good,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ve improved the fit on many garments and, for the first time in a number of years, we\u2019ve grown full-price market share.\u201d\nRowe has promised a less slavish pursuit of catwalk trends after being criticised for failing to meet the needs of its middle-aged customer base. \nHis new strategy is an about turn from that of his predecessor Marc Bolland, who believed the retailer could be a global brand and reopened stores in France after a decade-long absence.\n\u201cWe have made mistakes in the past and we are taking action to correct some of these,\u201d said Rowe, who revealed M&S would continue to expand overseas using a franchise model. The mistakes are expensive ones \u2013 it will cost up to \u00a3200m to shut loss-making stores in European markets such as France, Belgium and the Netherlands as well as outposts in China.\n\n\n\n\n"},

Half of the customers had money taken from their accounts, which are operated through an app or online. Customers have reported that sums have been transferred to Spain and Brazil.\nThe National Crime Agency (NCA) is one of a number of organisations scrutinising what has taken place at the supermarket chain\u2019s banking arm, which has more than 7 million customers.\nA new division of the surveillance agency GCHQ \u2013 the National Cyber Security Centre \u2013 confirmed it was working with the NCA which has launched a criminal inquiry. The NCSC, created only last month as the UK\u2019s authority on cybersecurity, said it was \u201cproviding direct assistance to the company at their request, including on-site assistance\u201d.\n\u201cIn the case of cyber-related incidents, it can, on certain occasions, take a significant period of time to understand the incident given the technical complexities involved. So the story will emerge over time. During this period it is vital that nothing is said publicly that could interfere with the criminal investigation,\u201d the NCSC said.\n\u201cGiven the investigation thus far and the evidence at hand, the National Cyber Security Centre is unaware of any wider threat to the UK banking sector connected with this incident.\u201d\nBailey told the MPs that the FCA was in close contact with Tesco and that the bank had reassured the regulator that customers whose money had been stolen would be reimbursed by the end of Tuesday.\nHe said it was too early to know the exact cause but said it appeared to be related to debit cards and that computer hackers were looking for weaknesses and \u201cpoints of entry\u201d into banks.\n\u201cIt looks like its [in] on-line banking, clearly appears to be on debit card side of online banking as far as we can tell. But it requires further urgent analysis ,\u201d said Bailey.\nHe said he was confident that Tesco knew which customers were affected by the incident which began to unfold on Saturday night when the bank began texting customers about unusual activity from their accounts.\nBut Tesco provided no update on the status of its customers on Tuesday after suspending online banking transactions for current accounts in the wake of the incident.\nBailey indicated that Tesco would not be able turn those facilities back on until it was confident it knew the service was safe for customers.\nA number of theories have circulated about the cause of the problem, including that it was caused by an internal security breach. Conservative MP Chris Philp, a member of the Treasury select committee, has raised the idea it could have been the work of a foreign power. \u201cI think we can\u2019t rule out the possibility, at all, that this is state-sponsored,\u201d he told the BBC earlier this week.\nAs the crisis was unfolding, Benny Higgins, chief executive of Tesco Bank, had said the decision to suspend some banking activities was an attempt to protect customers from \u201conline criminal activity\u201d.\nHiggins, who has apologised to customers, has described the raid as \u201ca systematic, sophisticated attack\u201d.\nThe NCSC said its role was to provide support to the investigation, work with the company concerned to manage the incident, investigate the root causes and use any lessons learned to provide future guidance and policy on cyber security.\nThe Information Commissioner\u2019s Office is also scrutinising the situation. It fined telecom company TalkTalk a record \u00a3400,000 in October for failing to stop the personal data of 157,000 customers being hacked. \nAndrew Tyrie, the Conservative MP who chairs the Treasury select committee, said after the hearing that \u201cthe attack on Tesco\u2019s retail accounts is deeply troubling. Banks have a long way to go to improve the resilience and security of their IT systems\u201d.\nAnother member of the committee, Steve Baker, said: \u201cthe vulnerability of Tesco Bank highlights the crucial importance of technical security to the financial system.\u201d\n"}
