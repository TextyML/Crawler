With such deep historical links between the two countries - surely the UK can cut through the bureaucratic smog that saw Brussels spend nearly a decade negotiating, but ultimately fail to agree a deal with the world's fastest growing economy. \nBut Indian business leaders are confused. No-one knows what the UK's relationship with Europe will eventually look like, and many are unsure about how much can be usefully discussed until the UK has withdrawn from the EU - a point that is at least two years away. \nSome things are clear and all too familiar. Trade and immigration are linked. If the UK wants better access to Indian markets, the government in Delhi wants a looser approach to UK work and student visas. This week saw Britain's visa rules for foreign visitors tightened. \nSpecific deals will be announced over the next 24 hours but more clarity around a trade relationship that has stagnated or even declined in recent years is likely to remain enveloped in the Delhi smog. \nVisa issues risk dominating Theresa May's first trade trip since becoming prime minister.\nIndia's Prime Minister Narendra Modi told a technology summit in Delhi he wanted to encourage \"greater mobility\" for its young people in education. \nHe said: \"Education is vital for our students and will define our engagement in a shared future. \n\"We must therefore encourage greater mobility and participation of young people in education and research opportunities.\"\nCobra Beer founder Lord Bilimoria earlier said restrictions on staying in the UK after their studies meant the number of Indians attending UK universities had halved in the past five years.\nHe said \"movement of people\" would form a key part of any trade negotiations.\nThe number of study visas issued to Indian nationals fell from 68,238 in the year to June 2010 to 11,864 five years later, official UK figures show.\nThe solution, according to Karan Bilimoria, is to exclude foreign students from Britain's statistics on net migration, which Mrs May has pledged to cut to below 100,000 annually - down from 336,000 in the year to June 2015.\n\"We need to immediately get the government, Theresa May, on this visit to announce and say 'we're no longer going to include international students within the net migration figures,'\" crossbencher Lord Bilimoria told BBC Radio 4's The World This Weekend.\nHe added: \"The reality is Theresa May when she was home secretary did deliver very, very negative messages towards immigration.\"\n\"She has got a lot of bridge-building to do when she goes to India.\"\nMrs May will be accompanied on the three-day trip by International Trade Secretary Liam Fox and trade minister Greg Hands as well as representatives from 33 UK companies.\nDeals expected to be confirmed during the trip include:\n", "url": "http://www.bbc.com/news/business-37891734", "title": "Theresa May rejects calls to raise Indian visa quota", "tags": ["economy"], "abstract": "Theresa May rejects calls to relax Indian visa rules, saying the UK has a \"good system\"."},

This week the National Institute for Economic and Social Research said it expected inflation to quadruple to about 4% in the second half of next year. \nThe think tank also warned that prices would \"accelerate rapidly\" during 2017 as the fall in sterling is passed on to consumers.\nExplaining the raised growth forecasts for this year and next, Bank governor Mark Carney said that, since the vote to leave the EU, household spending had held up better than expected.\n\"For households, the signs of an economic slowdown are notable by their absence,\" he said.\nBut he warned that households would see \"very modest\" growth in their incomes over the coming years.\nThe Bank of England argues that food and energy prices have stopped falling and an increase in the price of imported goods will weigh on household budgets.\nThe Bank also warned that Britain's access to EU markets could be \"materially reduced\" following Brexit, which would hit economic growth over a \"protracted period\".\nThe pound jumped higher against the dollar and euro - to $1.24 and \u20ac1.12 - following the Bank's move away from a rate cut and the High Court's ruling that parliament must vote on the start of the Brexit process. \nMr Carney said the court defeat for the government was \"just one of many twists and turns that are likely to happen\" as the UK leaves the European Union.\nHe told BBC economics editor Kamal Ahmed there was already economic uncertainty about Brexit, but that at the moment households were \"looking through that uncertainty\".\nThe Bank governor also reiterated he would leave his post in 2019, even if the court ruling means the Brexit process is delayed.\n", "url": "http://www.bbc.com/news/business-37860880", "title": "Bank sees sharp rise in inflation in 2017", "tags": ["economy"], "abstract": "The Bank of England makes a dramatic rise in its inflation forecast, with no rate cut expected in 2016."},
{"text": "Bank of England governor Mark Carney has said he will be staying on an extra year after his initial term comes to an end in 2018, to help oversee the UK's Brexit negotiations with the European Union.\nMr Carney's decision came after increasing speculation about his future as the head of the Bank of England.\nGovernors are traditionally appointed for an eight-year term, but when Mr Carney took the job in 2013 he initially signed up for five years, with an option for a further three. He has now said he will stay until June 2019.\nIn his letter to Chancellor Philip Hammond, Mr Carney said his move should help \"contribute to securing an orderly transition to the UK's new relationship with Europe\".\nDuring the referendum, Mr Carney had come under pressure from some Brexit campaigners for his remarks that voting to leave the EU would push the UK into a recession - seen by some as outside the governor's non-political remit.\nThe governor defended his intervention, saying the Bank's role was to \"identify risks, not to cross your fingers and hope risks would go away\". \nNevertheless, this sparked calls for him to resign.\nMr Carney \"never seems to want to recognise the result of the referendum and get on with it,\" said one MP, Jacob Rees-Mogg, recently. \nSince his arrival three years ago, Mr Carney has presided over measures designed to boost the UK economy in the aftermath of the global economic crisis.\nThere have been bouts of quantitative easing - pumping money directly into the financial system.\nHe introduced a policy of \"forward guidance\" at the Bank, also aimed at raising confidence; though just six months after its implementation in 2013 this needed a rethink.\nThe Bank had originally said it would not consider raising interest rates until the unemployment rate fell to 7% or below.\nBut when that seemed likely to happen much sooner than anticipated the Bank altered its stance, saying it would focus on a range of economic variables rather than just the jobless numbers before changing rates.  \nBut Mr Carney did then give clear hints that rates would have to gradually rise towards 2017.\nInstead, the opposite has happened, and in the wake of the UK's Brexit vote the Bank actually cut rates to 0.25% this summer. \nWhen Mark Carney became the Bank of England's governor in June 2013, he was the first non-Briton to be appointed in the Bank's 300-year history.\nHe came after a successful stint as Canada's central banker, where he was credited for shielding the country from some of the worst effects of the 2008 financial crisis.\nIn March 2008, just a month after his appointment, he cut Canadian interest rates. This and other measures helped boost market confidence and enabled Canada to recover from the crisis more quickly than some of its peers.\nLikened more than once to the Hollywood actor George Clooney, ahead of his arrival in the UK Mr Carney was touted as a \"rock star\" banker, a change from the usual Bank of England head.\n\"He's got star quality, and he knows how to use it,\" said fellow Canadian and former government colleague Scott Reid.\nMr Carney's appointment was a break with tradition in many ways. \nHe had a commercial banking, as well as a public sector background - unlike his two most recent predecessors who had spent their careers within the Bank of England and academia.  \nMr Carney worked for investment banking giant Goldman Sachs in New York before returning to Canada to work for the country's Finance Department - and then Canada's central bank.\nAnother difference was the size of his pay packet, which was well above that of his predecessor, Sir Mervyn King.\nHis starting annual salary of \u00a3480,000 (plus \u00a3144,000 pension allowance) was \u00a3175,000 more than Sir Mervyn received - and that's not counting his \u00a3250,000 annual accommodation allowance.\nSo what is it about Mr Carney that separates him from other central bankers? \n\"He's extraordinarily charismatic,\" says Scott Reid. \"You go to his speeches and you'll find them just as dry as anyone's. \n\"But it's the way he does things, he takes the time to linger on you... and the public and the press find that very intoxicating.\n\"He such a fetching figure - but let's not be shy about that. He's conscious of it. He's shrewd when it comes to his image.\"\nMarried to an Englishwoman, the 48-year-old's postgraduate education was at Oxford University, where he studied economics.\nHis former tutor during his Masters degree, economist Peter Oppenheimer, says \"he was a typically bright, transatlantic student\". \n\"That sounds terribly old fashioned, but he wasn't the sort of young man who walked around in torn sweaters.\" \nProf Oppenheimer says Mr Carney was an interesting choice to run the Bank of England. \"He wasn't an insider, he wasn't an academic economist, and he was a practical banker of a certain kind. \n\"The really good governors of the post-Second World War period have been people with practical banking experience, such as Gordon Richardson and Robin Leigh-Pemberton. \n\"They have been the outstanding governors. More so than Bank insiders, or people with long academic careers.\" \nIt's been said Mr Carney wanted to stay to help the UK through the challenges of Brexit, and that leaving early might be seen by some of his critics as admitting defeat.\nCrucially, he has the backing of the Prime Minister, Theresa May, who believes he is the right person to be Bank of England governor.\nThere is also the matter of market confidence. \nFollowing the referendum result and all the personnel changes in the Conservative government, many in the markets see Mr Carney as one of the few voices of continuity in the UK. \n", "url": "http://www.bbc.com/news/business-23050597", "title": "Mark Carney: The 'film star' Bank of England governor", "tags": ["economy"], "abstract": "When Mark Carney became the Bank of England's governor in 2013 he was the first non-Briton to be appointed in the Bank's 300-year history.

{"text": "Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi has announced that the 500 ($7.60) and 1,000 rupee banknotes will be withdrawn from the financial system overnight.\nThe surprise move, announced on Tuesday evening, is part of a crackdown on corruption and illegal cash holdings. \nBanks will be closed on Wednesday and ATM machines will not be working.\nIndia is overwhelmingly a cash economy. New 500 and 2,000 rupee denomination notes will be issued to replace those removed from circulation.  \n\"Black money and corruption are the biggest obstacles in eradicating poverty,\" Mr Modi said.\nPeople will be able to exchange their old notes for new ones at banks over the next 50 days but they will no longer be legal tender.\nThe announcement prompted people across the country to rush to ATMs that offer 100 rupee notes in an attempt not to be left without cash over the next few days.\nThe move is designed to lock out money that is unaccounted for - known as \"black money \" - which may have been acquired corruptly, or be being withheld from the tax authorities. \nFinance Secretary Shaktikant Das warned people with large stashes of hidden cash that banks would closely monitor the exchange of old notes for new ones.\nMr Modi has set his stall out as a modernising, anti-corruption crusade. \nScrapping notes that are very, very common is his biggest offensive yet. Most transactions in daily life are in cash and 45% of those are in notes in denominations of 500 rupees and over.\nNot a single news organisation seemed to know this was coming. I saw one news anchor produce a wad of 500s from his own pocket on air wondering whether these were now just pieces of paper - and also wondering if the bars of Delhi would see a sudden surge of business.\nIt has caught the country completely off guard.

His government is half way through its term of office.\nThe announcement comes just over a month after the government raised nearly $10bn through a tax amnesty for Indians to declare hidden income and assets.\nThe BBC's Justin Rowlatt in Delhi says the issue of \"black money\" is a huge problem in India and the latest move is the prime minister's big demonstration that he is taking it seriously.\nThe idea is to lock out money that is unaccounted for and make it visible for tax purposes - banks will be happy to exchange a few thousand rupees, but will be asking questions of those who turn up with hundreds of thousands or millions in currency.\nThere are no precise figures available but experts say the government's move could be \"a very powerful measure\" to curb \"black money\".  IIFL Holdings Ltd Chairman Nirmal Jain told Bloomberg that it will have \"a deflationary impact in general and more specifically on real estate prices - making homes affordable\".\nIt seems not. An individual can put as much as he or she likes into the bank - but withdrawals are limited so the banking system may end up being flooded with cash.\nGovernment guidelines say it is possible to exchange 4,000 rupees - but it is not clear if this is per day or in total.\nCritics say the new rules may make it especially difficult for people who choose to keep their cash at home rather than in a bank account and for people with large rupee cash reserves who live abroad.\n If there is a legitimate explanation for the cash, the authorities say, it will be possible to exchange it.\nCash points will close on Wednesday and in some places also on Thursday - a development that it seems may cause cash blockages or queues at ATMs.\nIt's a bold step because many people who voted for Mr Modi were small traders who overwhelmingly did their business in cash.\nOur correspondent says these are people who probably do have a few hundred thousand rupees - a few thousand dollars - stored under their beds and will have problems when they turn up in the bank on Thursday trying to change their money.\nThe move leaves a lot of uncertainty about the Indian economy at least in the short term.\n", "url": "http://www.bbc.com/news/business-37906742", "title": "India scraps 500 and 1,000 rupee bank notes overnight", "tags": ["economy"], "abstract": "India's PM says existing 500 and 1,000 rupee banknotes will be withdrawn from the financial system overnight."},

She respects the right of the rest of the UK to leave the EU, but wants to protect the interests of Scotland which voted against Brexit.\nIt may be she is simply trying to increase her leverage over Theresa May to try and secure a particular Brexit deal for Scotland - something Mrs May has already ruled out.\nBut there is another problem and it is on delay - the danger that Brexit gets snarled up in the courts. \nWe have already had the High Court ruling - the Supreme Court  will decide on the appeal in January - and now Scottish lawyers are piling in and the danger is the timetable of triggering Brexit by March gets put through the legal shredder.\nThe first minister said: \"The Scottish government is clear that triggering Article 50 will directly affect devolved interests and rights in Scotland. \n\"And triggering Article 50 will inevitably deprive Scottish people and Scottish businesses of rights and freedoms which they currently enjoy.\n\"It simply cannot be right that those rights can be removed by the UK government on the say-so of a prime minister without parliamentary debate, scrutiny or consent.\"\nShe also urged the prime minister to \"live up to her promise to treat Scotland as an equal partner in the United Kingdom and listen to the will of the people of Scotland\".\nAnswering questions from journalists, the first minister was pressed on the basis on which the Scottish government will seek to involve itself in the case.\nShe said: \"If there is a need for legislation in the House of Commons that raises the question of legislative consent, not just in the Scottish Parliament but in Wales and Northern Ireland as well.\n\"If that is going to be an issue that the court is looking at... then it is absolutely right that the Scottish government is formally represented to make sure that the views that we would take around these processes are heard by the court.\"\nThe first minister said she would not go into the detail of what the Lord Advocate will argue, but made it clear she personally believes the UK government should seek approval for triggering Article 50 through a legislative consent motion at Holyrood.\nShe also said she believes there are those both in the Welsh and Northern Irish governments who would take a similar view about their own parliaments.\nMs Sturgeon is due to unveil proposals for a \"flexible Brexit\" - which would see Scotland remain in the single market even if the rest of the UK leaves - in the coming weeks. \nThe Supreme Court has set aside four days, from 5 until 8 December, for the appeal hearing, which will see all 11 Supreme Court justices sit on the panel.\nJudgment will be reserved at the conclusion of that hearing and follow at a later date, probably in the new year.\nAll five parties in the Scottish Parliament backed remaining in the EU ahead of the referendum, but the Scottish Conservatives, Labour and Liberal Democrats have warned Ms Sturgeon against using the result to push for a second vote on Scottish independence.\nScottish Labour said it supported the objective of getting the \"best possible deal for Scotland\", which it said meant \"remaining part of the UK and retaining a close \nScottish Greens MSP Ross Greer said it was \"reasonable that MSPs who represent the people of Scotland are consulted before any steps are taken to remove us from Europe against our wishes.\"\nAnd Scottish Lib Dem leader Willie Rennie called on the prime minister to \"end all this and simply accept that there must be a democratic vote before Article 50 is invoked\". \n", "url": "http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-37909299", "title": "Scottish government seeks to intervene in Brexit case", "tags": ["politics"], "abstract": "The Scottish government will seek to oppose the UK government in the Supreme Court over Article 50."},

He has suggested that Nato countries which do not pay their dues into the military alliance could lose US protection in the event of an invasion by, say, Russia.\nThe UK would not be directly affected by that, as it has met its Nato spending target. But, as the country leaves an EU moving towards closer defence and foreign policy ties, could this cause problems?\n\"A stronger Nato would suit a Brexited UK better,\" says Kori Schake, who acted as senior policy adviser to Republican presidential candidate John McCain in 2008. \n\"But I also think he'll quickly discover how much the US gets from our allies and how important their contributions are to what the US tries to get done in the world.  It's pretty lonely out there without Nato allies.\"\nBefore the European Union referendum, President Barack Obama warned the UK it would go to \"the back of the queue\" for signing trade deals with the US if it opted for Brexit. Mr Trump, however, has been far more positive.\nHis trade adviser, Dan DiMicco, said last month that he \"absolutely\" wanted to do a deal with the UK as soon as possible after Brexit, which is set to happen in early-to-mid-2019.\n\"I could see that happening,\" says Ms Schake, \"especially since the EU seems unwilling to move forward with the US-EU deal.  \n\"A bilateral agreement with Britain could be a huge opportunity for Trump to prove he's in favour of 'the right kind of deals'.  But whether that would constitute a good deal for Britain is more difficult to say.\"\nMr Trump's election website does not mention Europe or the UK in its section on trade, focusing more on relations with China and Pacific countries.\nTheresa May did not offer an opinion on the candidate she would prefer as US president. But last year, after Mr Trump suggested that parts of London had become so radicalised that police did not dare enter, she called his remarks \"divisive, unhelpful and wrong\".\nAsked about these last month, Mrs May played down the significance of her criticism, saying: \"I made those comments in relation to some particular references he had made.\"\nForeign Secretary Boris Johnson has also made quips at Mr Trump's expense and MPs have even held a debate on barring him from the UK. So, in the early days of the Trump administration, one might anticipate some awkward moments, requiring delicate diplomacy.\n\"The UK government has a genius for figuring out how to get along with and be influential with new American administrations,\" says Ms Schake, who works as a research fellow at Stanford University's Hoover Institution.\nTony Blair managed to move from a close friendship with Bill Clinton to another with George W Bush. \nMore trickily, in 1992, John Major's Conservative Party, fresh from an unexpected victory over Labour, helped George HW Bush's re-election campaign. Bush lost to Clinton and there was some initial awkwardness, which was overcome.\nThe problem is, Ms Schake argues, that \"Trump seems to be exceedingly thin-skinned and grudge-holding\", adding: \"But it's a mighty large crowd of foreigners who've had alarming or disparaging things to say, so he won't have much choice other than to take friends where he can get them.\"\nPersonal relationships are key to diplomacy and civil servants will have been gleaning as much information on Mr Trump and his potential team as they can.\n\"Hillary Clinton is clearly extremely well known in the UK. People will know the sort of people she's looking to use in her administration,\" said Jill Rutter, a former Downing Street and Treasury civil servant who works for the Institute for Government, her comments coming before the US voted.\n\"Often the people in senior positions will have held more junior or middling roles in previous ones, so you can build connections.\n\"I would have thought that extremely difficult with Trump. You can look back at the George W Bush administration, but how many of the people who served in it would do the same for Trump?\"\nMany mainstream Republicans criticised or refused to endorse Mr Trump, including both Presidents Bush and Mr McCain.\nWe know his running mate, Indiana Governor Mike Pence, will be vice-president. Other senior figures in his campaign include New Jersey Governor Chris Christie and former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani.\nMr Trump is a famous man, with a long career in business and a stint in reality TV, but, argues Mr Oliver, he comes with many \"known unknowns\", particularly the identities of those who would serve in his administration.\nAnother complication exists. In the US, senior appointees have to be confirmed by the Senate. Even with a Republican majority, the party establishment may be less than helpful, making personnel even harder to predict.\nThen, says Mr Oliver, the UK, and the rest of the world, will have to deal with \"unknown unknowns, such as what Trump might say or do next\".\n\"I don't know to what extent the British embassy in Washington has been able to get close to the Trump campaign,\" said Ms Rutter.\n\"If he gets elected, then we will have to go into the Washington version of Kremlinology, trying to work out what's really going on.\"\nWell, that's started.\n", "url": "http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-37851551", "title": "What does a Donald Trump win mean for UK politics?", "tags": ["politics"], "abstract": "Donald Trump will be the next president of the United States, but what might it mean for the UK?"},

It's moved from the NHS, so local authorities should be including that in their day-to-day decision-making anyway.\"\nShe said: \"It's about individuals understanding what they are doing to themselves, to their bodies, to their health. There's a responsibility on the licensees, I would argue, or there should be under this objective, to make people aware.\n\"Just like we have on cigarette packets exactly what happens to you if you choose to smoke, it should say what happens to you if you choose to drink - and if you choose to drink to a certain amount, what that might have. \n\"It might be calories. It might be 'this is the amount of calories you are taking in'.\n\"It might be public health information service that says the impact of sustained drinking over time. It may be that it affects the cost of the alcohol sale.\"\nBut Lord Davies was sceptical, admitting that previous public health campaigns on sugar consumption and smoking had worked, but wondering how landlords could do the same for alcohol.\nHe said: \"It's quite unclear to me how they would apply a public health criterion in [granting licences]...

{"text": "Engineers have finished assembling the telescope that will succeed Hubble.\nThe huge new observatory known as James Webb is on track to be launched in exactly two years from now.\nIt will go into space on a European Ariane rocket from French Guiana, but before that is possible the delicate hardware must be tested to ensure it will survive the ride.\nThis work will begin in the coming weeks at the US space agency\u2019s (Nasa) Goddard space centre in Maryland.\n\"We have to shake it as it will be shaken by the rocket,\" explained senior project scientist John Mather. \n\"Number two: we have to put loud noises on it, as it will feel the loud noises on launch - 150 decibels or something.\n\"From here we go down to [the Johnson space centre in Texas] and prove that it focuses. That was the number one challenge: how do you know it will focus in space, especially after we learned that Hubble was not quite in focus when we launched?\n\"We\u2019ve learned how to do that.\" \nThe James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) is a cooperative venture between Nasa and its European and Canadian counterparts. \nWhen the contributions from all the parties are included, the value of this next-generation science facility is close to $10bn.\nWebb will carry technologies capable of detecting the light from the first stars to shine in the Universe. \nIt will also reveal in unprecedented detail the chemistry and behaviour of planets far beyond our Solar System.\nTo help achieve this, it is fitted with a mirror that has a diameter of 6.5m - roughly seven times the light-collecting area of Hubble's main mirror.\nThis reflector is so big in fact that it must be capable of folding. \nOnly by turning the edges inwards will the beryllium/gold segments fit inside the enclosure atop the Ariane.\nAfter years of development, the past 12 months have finally seen the telescope take on a recognisable form. And on Wednesday, Nasa called a media event to showcase the progress and to mark the milestone of two years to lift-off.\nSo far, everything is on track. \u201cWe\u2019re on schedule and on cost,\u201d said Nasa Administrator Charles Bolden.\nAlthough we talk of the \"telescope\" being finished, this really only refers to the optical parts of the observatory - its mirrors and instruments. \nNot yet incorporated into the full structure is the spacecraft bus, or chassis - that part that includes all the housekeeping hardware like the computers, telecommunications systems, and the thrusters to maintain Webb\u2019s position in orbit. \nNor have engineers attached the giant shield that will shade Webb's observations from the light of our Sun.\n\"The sunshield is as big a tennis court,\" quipped Dr Mather. \"Try to imagine Roger Federer and Rafa (Nadal) running back and forth on our telescope. Imagine how large that is and what a difficult job it was. But it\u2019s finished.\"\nAerospace contractor Northrop Grumman, which leads the Webb industrial programme, will bring all the elements together once this next phase of critical testing is done.\nJames Webb is a flagship mission for Nasa, Esa and CSA. It is also a high-risk project for them all. \nAssuming the observatory survives the dangers of launch, it will take roughly six months to prepare for use by astronomers.\nThis commissioning period will involve a number of pivotal stages such as the unpacking of the mirror and the unfurling of the five-membrane sunshield. \nWebb must then also be left to chill down to make it sensitive to the infrared light coming from the most distant stars in the cosmos.\nThose six months ahead of routine science are already being dubbed the \"six months of terror\" because of the requirement for all of the in-space deployments to go exactly to plan.  And unlike with Hubble, there will be no astronauts available to fix a problem after launch because Webb will be stationed too far away for them to reach - about 1.5 million km from Earth.\nThis underlined the need to make sure the coming months\u2019 testing was performed with care, said Dr Mather. \"We need to make sure we won\u2019t be terrified by doing our job now.\"\nJonathan.Amos-INTERNET@bbc.co.uk and follow me on Twitter: @BBCAmos\n", "url": "http://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-37861015", "title": "James Webb: Two years to Hubble successor's launch", "tags": ["science"], "abstract": "Engineers finish assembling the telescope that will succeed Hubble.

The last major climate deal - the Kyoto Protocol - took eight years to come into force. Paris is the first agreement tying rich and poor nations in a common endeavour to protect the climate. However, the national targets for cutting carbon emissions are voluntary. The UN tried a mandatory approach but countries that were failing to meet their targets simply quit. \nThe process of the Paris deal is binding, including a commitment for governments to keep returning to the issue to ratchet up the clean energy targets that they all agree are inadequate.

{"text": "\"Dare to fail\" is one of those mantras that engineers like to repeat. It's how you learn.\nThat is certainly the attitude being taken by the European Space Agency (Esa) in the wake of its Schiaparelli mishap.\nThe probe's telemetry is still being analysed but it looks increasingly like the Italian-built robot did not make a soft landing on Wednesday.\nQuite the contrary. It very probably hit the ground at high speed after jettisoning its parachute too early and firing its thrusters for only a few seconds.\nBut Esa is holding to the line that no firm conclusions can be drawn until a full reconstruction of events is made from the telemetry.\nAnd even if it is shown that Schiaparelli crashed, we should still consider it a partial success. The reason? We will know why it didn't work and the lessons can then be taken forward to make sure the next landing achieves a better outcome. \nTo repeat another of those mantras: \"You're allowed to fail so long as you understand why you failed.\"\nFor Esa's ExoMars programme, of which Schiaparelli was a part, the stakes could not be higher, however. \nThe next phase - the next landing - for ExoMars would see a British-assembled rover try to put down on the Red Planet in 2021.\nThis six-wheeled robot is an expensive project and is already struggling to get the full funding it needs to proceed.\nDecisions on its budget will now be clouded by what has happened this week.\nSchiaparelli was touted as the technology demonstrator - the project that would give scientists and engineers the experience, expertise and confidence to go forward with 2021.\nThey will certainly have filled their store of knowledge. By the bucket load. But will Esa member-state ministers meeting in December still have the stomach for another Mars landing, and - more to the point - the enthusiasm to part with the 300m euros that is likely needed to carry the rover project through to completion?\nIn a press conference at Esa's mission control on Thursday, the agency's director-general Jan Woerner was bullish in his assessment of how member states would react. The progress that had been made would be \"obvious\" to them, he said. We'll see.\nAt a minimum, the ministers will want the board of inquiry set up in the wake of Schiaparelli's apparent loss to report quickly, with a clear and detailed explanation of the things that went wrong and how they can be put right.\nOn the plus side, Esa officials can point to the outstanding success of getting Schiaparelli's \"mothership\" into orbit. The Trace Gas Orbiter, as it is known, has the potential to deliver some fascinating insights on Mars' atmosphere and what its rarest molecules might say about the existence of life at the Red Planet today.\nOriginally, no observations were planned for many months while the TGO tidied up its orbit. Now, mission mangers are expecting to squeeze in some early science, just in time for those end-of-year deliberations. A good performance would be timely and perhaps give the ministers a feel-good factor.\nAnd then next week, the key parties working on the rover - including their Russian partners - will conduct a major review of the status of the much-delayed project.\nThe findings also will inform the coming budget discussions.\nIt would be a massive blow to European pride if ministers decided to abandon the aspiration to land on Mars (and the cause of no little disappointment in the UK where rover prototypes have been significant \"vehicles\" for STEM inspiration and education).\nIt would also highlight Europe's deficiency in its exploration of the Solar System. \nBeyond TGO, Esa has a satellite planned for Mercury and one for Jupiter. But neither is near-term.\nThe former doesn't get to its target until the mid-2020s, and the latter doesn't start serious science until 2030. \nThere's a daring mission to fly close to the Sun that will launch in 2018, but that's not a planetary body - not one you can land on anyway. \nAnd if we've learnt anything in the past couple of years with the Rosetta comet mission, it is that the public is most engaged when probes touch down on something.\n", "url": "http://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-37722026", "title": "Schiaparelli: The imperative to touch another world", "tags": ["science"], "abstract": "Landing on planetary bodies is hard - as we saw with Europe's Schiaparelli probe - but it is the space endeavour that most engages the public."},
{"text": "Recent centuries have seen a big jump in the rates of erosion in the iconic chalk cliffs on England's south coast.\nA new study finds that for thousands of years the rocks were being beaten back by the waves at perhaps 2-6cm a year.\nThe past 150 years has seen this retreat accelerate 10-fold, to more than 20cm a year.\nThe speed-up was clocked with the aid of a smart technique that tracks changes induced in rocks when they are exposed to energetic space particles.\nThe research, led from the British Geological Survey and conducted by Martin Hurst and colleagues, is reported in the leading American journal, the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.\nThe group believes the findings will help us understand some of the coming impacts of climate change.  \n\"Our coasts are going to change in the future as a result of sea-level rise and perhaps increased storminess, and we want this work to inform better forecasts of erosion,\" Dr Hurst, currently affiliated to Glasgow University, told BBC News.\nThe research was centred on East Sussex and its towering cliffs at Beachy Head and Hope Gap.\nOriginally laid down 90 million years ago, these soft chalk faces are now being eaten away by the relentless pounding they get from the sea.\nDr Hurst's team was able to estimate the pace of this reversal by examining the amount of beryllium-10 in nodules of flint embedded in the eroded platform in front of the cliffs.\nThe radioactive element is produced when cosmic rays - that constantly shower the Earth - hit oxygen atoms in the flints' quartz minerals.\nThe longer the nodules have been exposed, the greater their build-up of beryllium-10.\nAt Beachy Head and Hope Gap, the gently sloping platform, which is only uncovered at low tide, extends seaward several hundred metres.\nIt represents all that is left after millennia of cliff removal. \n\"The lower rates of erosion that we report - about 2.5cm at Hope Gap and around 6cm at Beachy Head - are averaged over that timeframe - through about the past 7,000 years of the Holocene,\" explained Dr Hurst.\n\"But comparing that to observations based on topographic maps and aerial photography of the last 150 years - the difference is quite stark. These historical observations from 1870 to the present suggest erosion rates of 20-30cm a year at the two sites.\"\nThe estimates of change in the deep past are tricky because the platform appears younger than it really is.\nThis stems from the fact that its surface continues to erode downwards, removing its oldest exposed flints. The regular tidal covering of water also has to be considered because it will restrict the flux of cosmic rays reaching the platform, thus limiting the amount of beryllium that can be induced in the nodules.\nBut the team is confident in its analysis and puts forward some ideas to explain the recent big up-tick in erosion.\nThese concern the available gravels at the foot of the cliffs that constitute the beach.\nOrdinarily, this material acts as a buffer, limiting the energy of crashing waves.\nBut there is good evidence that the beaches in this region of the south coast have got thinner through time and perhaps therefore offer less protection today than they once did.\nIn the modern era, groynes and sea walls have been erected further down the coast and these may have interfered with the along-shore transport of gravels. And further back in time, several hundred years ago, it is possible also that there was a phase of more storms. These could have removed significant volumes of gravel and pushed the rates of erosion into a new, more aggressive regime that persists even now.\nCo-author Dr Dylan Rood from Imperial College London told BBC News: \"The coast is clearly eroding, and Britain has retreated fast. A nearly tenfold increase in retreat rates over a very short timescale, in geological terms, is remarkable. \n\"The UK cannot leave the issue of cliff erosion unresolved in the face of a warming world and rising sea levels.

But it could yet turn around for Hamilton.\nRosberg is playing the calculated game, which is exactly the right thing to do. His job is to win the World Championship.

But he is not always on his game, and that is what gives Rosberg hope.\nAnd you have to say that, after being given a kicking last year, Rosberg has left no stone unturned in his pursuit of this year's title.\nIf Hamilton pulls this back from the position he is in, it will have been a masterful achievement.

A good example was 2012, when Sebastian Vettel was so nearly taken out in a first-lap collision, but survived and hung on to the championship by the skin of his teeth as his rival Fernando Alonso finished second but did not quite make up enough ground.\nThe Mexican Grand Prix ended in something close to farce. In more than 30 years in motorsport, I have never seen such a crazy situation as three people finishing third in an F1 race.\nVerstappen crossed the line third but was demoted before he got to the podium. A frustrated Vettel went to the podium and therefore had to answer all the questions he did not want to be asked. And then he found out he, too, had been penalised and the guy who finished fifth, Verstappen's team-mate Daniel Ricciardo, was ultimately classified third.\nIt was a strange race, in that a manic first lap and crazy finish - produced by the various tyre strategies of Verstappen, Vettel and Ricciardo - bookended what was in between a pretty dull grand prix.\nThe series of controversial incidents during the race in Mexico City have led to a lot of discussion about Formula 1's rules and regulations in such circumstances.\nMany people - including Verstappen himself - have pointed out what they see as a contradiction between the fact that race-winner Hamilton did not receive a penalty for cutting across the grass at Turns One and Two on the first lap, and that Verstappen did for doing it later in the race.\nI have been an official driver steward at a number of grands prix. And the way the rules are operated - and all the drivers and teams know about this - there was no contradiction.\nFirstly, the start and first lap are treated differently from the rest of the race. That's not to say you can get away with anything - as was proved when Carlos Sainz was penalised for pushing Fernando Alonso on to the grass - dirty driving is still dirty driving and will be punished.\nBut little incidents, details of driving, are tolerated that would not be during the main part of the race, simply because it's an inevitably more hectic environment with so many cars together at the same time.\nOn the first lap, Hamilton locked a wheel and ran wide at Turn One. He cut across the grass and rejoined in Turn Two.\nThere were several reasons why he was not given a penalty: it was the first lap, when there is more latitude; he was not fighting with anyone - he was clearly in the lead and the battle was for second behind him; and he lifted off as soon as he rejoined the track.\nThat was quick and clear thinking from Hamilton and it was crucial because the stewards work on the basis of a rule that dictates a driver must not gain a \"lasting advantage\" by going off the track.\nThe lock-up and flat spot meant Hamilton ended up in a risky situation - it means big vibrations that not only shake the driver around but also risk breaking the suspension.\nThis famously happened to Kimi Raikkonen at the Nurburgring in 2005. He led much of the way, ran a long time on a tyre with a flat-spot on it, and the suspension shattered on the very last lap of the race.\nVerstappen fitted his medium tyres to take him to the end of the race on lap 12, whereas Vettel did not stop until lap 33 - so had tyres with 21 laps less wear on them.\nComing up behind them was Ricciardo, who fitted new soft tyres on lap 51, with only 20 laps to go.\nOn old medium tyres, it is easier to lose tyre temperature on long straights, which was almost certainly a contributing factor to Verstappen locking up at the start of lap 68.\nHe went off the track and across the grass within half a metre or so of the line Hamilton had been on at the start. \nCould he have got the car back on to the track? Almost certainly. But he would have lost at least one position to Vettel and probably another to Ricciardo as well.\nThe problem was that going across the grass meant he gained and kept a lasting advantage as opposed to losing one. Hence the penalty.\nVerstappen's refusal to give the place to Vettel set up Ricciardo's attack on the German on the penultimate lap, as the Ferrari was being held back to the Dutchman's pace.\nRicciardo got a good run on Vettel out of Turn Two and I was surprised that Vettel did not move to the inside earlier to cover and try to send him around the outside - especially as he said afterwards he knows Ricciardo will often have an \"optimistic\" attempt, without question or hesitancy.\nThat gave Ricciardo a chance to have a go down the inside and he went for it at the exact moment they were coming into the braking area.\nVettel started to close the space in the braking area. This is something that has been discussed at a lot of drivers' briefings this season, predominantly in the context of Verstappen's driving.\nA new clarification was brought out at the US Grand Prix, the week before Mexico, spelling out what was acceptable in this area.\nThe FIA said drivers' could not make any change in direction in the braking area that led to another driver having to take evasive action.\nWhy is this area so sensitive? Think back to the Australian Grand Prix at the start of the season. There, owing to a misunderstanding in the braking area, Fernando Alonso's McLaren was launched over Esteban Gutierrez's Haas into an almighty accident.\nThose are the risks of moving in the braking area.\nSo it was hardly surprising that the move was investigated and Vettel ended up being penalised.\nThe stewards did well to give Verstappen his penalty early enough before the podium ceremony; it was just a shame they could not manage that in time to get Ricciardo up on to the podium.\nVettel has escaped sanction for the expletive-laden tirade he launched over the radio in the race.\nBut he has to bear in mind that he now has six penalty points on his licence - and if any driver gets 12 in any 12-month period, that is an automatic one-race ban.\nThe Vettel we are seeing now - both in and out of the car - is not the same man who won four consecutive world titles with Red Bull, or even who won three races for Ferrari last year.\nFerrari came into this season expecting to challenge Mercedes, but it has been a disappointing year, with questionable strategy and technical errors. \nIt looked for a while as if Vettel might win the opening race of the season in Australia, only for the team to make a bad strategic call when the race was stopped for Alonso's accident. Another potential victory went begging in Canada for similar reasons.\nThey have been leapfrogged by Red Bull - Vettel's former team - and only at seven of the 19 races so far this year has Ferrari's gap to pole position been closer than it was in 2015.\nIt has become a very frustrating season and there is no question there is a lot of pressure on that team.\nEmotions are running high, and you can hear it in Vettel's radio messages, about slower drivers, blue flags, people blocking him - all expressed in the manner of someone who is very frustrated.\nYes, they are being broadcast. But they are being broadcast because he is making them. If he didn't, they couldn't broadcast them.\nHis comments about FIA F1 director Charlie Whiting - even though they were rooted in the fact that he felt no action was being taken about Verstappen, whose driving Vettel has been unhappy with on a number of occasions this year - are the ones that really caused an uproar.\nWhen you're in the car, the emotions run high. Your brain is processing things at 200mph and all the energy and adrenalin means these things can bubble out. \nI've done it as well. I remember in one race I was complaining about something and my engineer came back and said: \"Allan, keep calm.\" The exact words Ferrari team boss Maurizio Arrivabene said to Vettel on Sunday. And I replied: \" I am ******* calm!\" Clearly, I wasn't.\nThe bizarre thing about it all is that Vettel was voted driver of the day by the fans, and I suspect it was at least as much to do with his outpouring of emotion as it was for his driving.\nSo, fine, warn Vettel about certain aspects of his behaviour. But the fans connect to the emotions and action involved, and F1 needs to be aware of that.\n", "url": "http://www.bbc.com/sport/formula1/37861016", "title": "Lewis Hamilton's world title fortune could turn around at Brazilian GP", "tags": ["sport"], "abstract": "Nico Rosberg's one-race-at-a-time approach could backfire on him at the Brazilian Grand Prix as the mind games intensify."},
{"text": "This has been the era where British sport has blessed its loyal followers like never before: fourth, third and second places in the Olympic medal table; the Tour de France yellow jersey won in four of the past five years; the miracle of a first male Wimbledon champion in 77 years, a marvel repeated three years on; the Davis Cup won for the first time since tennis was played in slacks and cable-knit jumpers.\nIt goes on. A first Olympic diving gold, a first Olympic gymnastics gold, and then a second, from the same man, a few hours later. Multiple Formula 1 world titles, Lions series won. The first woman in history to win an Olympic boxing gold, the first to retain one too.\nAnd now another bequest, from a man who has already provided so much. A British tennis player as world number one is an idea as ludicrous to recent memory as anything else in that giddy list, but with Andy Murray, we should no longer be surprised. \nTo a nation systematically unable to produce tennis champions despite finances and facilities at the elite level to embarrass others as well as itself, Murray is the gift that keeps giving.\nOnly 26 men have held that solitary ranking since the calculations went computerised 43 years ago. It is not a gimmick, or a marketing exercise, or even a reward in itself, but a defining benchmark. You cannot fluke it or get lucky with a judging panel. It is deserved. It is definitive.\n\"Being number one is the pinnacle of all the ambitions of every player,\" said Novak Djokovic, the man just deposed, when he began his own long reign three years ago. \"This is the dream.\"\nIt hasn't made every player happy. The only certain thing about being world number one is that the day will come when you will no longer be world number one.\nAndre Agassi has described how miserable it made him, how the achievement seemed to legitimise his father's cruel ambitions and obsessions rather than his own. John McEnroe, who spent a cumulative total of 170 weeks at the top of the pile, found it lonely atop the exposed summit.\n\"You're out there on your own island,\" he once said. \"And you feel like you're disengaged, not only with the rest of the world, but the rest of your competitors, some of them friends.\"\nClimbing the mountain is often an easier task in sport than defending your splendid isolation. \nThe England rugby union team who won the World Cup in 2003, having gone into that tournament as Grand Slam winners and on an unbeaten home run stretching back 22 games and four years, finished third in the subsequent Six Nations and fourth in the next two.\n\"In a game, thousands of decisions are being made, but it only needs a few to be the wrong ones for the team's fortunes to reverse,\" says Matt Dawson, scrum-half in that team. \"When it goes, it goes quickly.\"\nIt was the same for the England cricket team who rose to number one in the Test rankings after beating India in the summer of 2011: whitewashed in their next Test series, against Pakistan in the UAE, and then dismantled at home to South Africa the following summer, losing their captain Andrew Strauss and, for a while, their star batsman Kevin Pietersen.\nBeing world number one gets you respect. It also makes you a target. Everyone wants your scalp. Every defeat is automatically a headline.\nEven your own motivation can begin to slide, if only subconsciously, if only by minute fractions. How to focus on the next target when you can climb no further? Where can you go from the top but down?\nMurray's character may insulate him from those uncertainties for a while yet.  \nFind out how to get into tennis in our special guide.\nThe 29-year-old's new position reflects both his own remarkable consistency over the past 12 months and the personal and physical problems that have shackled Djokovic, but it is also testament to a desire for self-improvement only occasionally found in sportsmen of his age.\nRanked 17th in the world a decade ago, he was gloriously log-jammed at four in those four seasons from 2008 to 2011, the unprecedented trio of Djokovic, Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal seeming to block any further ascent. \nHe dropped to sixth in 2014 after his back surgery and then appeared stymied at second for the past year as 12-time Grand Slam champion Djokovic went through the peak of his reign.\nThe belief and the hard work never dropped off. Different coaches, tweaked training, a renewed focus on the basics that, in this year alone, has seen his second serve refashioned and accelerated.\nIn defeat by Kei Nishikori in the US Open quarter-finals in September and Juan Martin del Potro in the Davis Cup semi-finals soon afterwards, he seemed physically spent - only to emerge revitalised in the past two months on this celebrated spree across first east Asia and now western Europe.\nAnd it is testament to self-belief too - that in an era decorated by three of the greatest players of all time, he could be crowned the best; that seven years and two months after first reaching number two, he could still take that final special step.\nPlenty of fine Grand Slam-winning players have never been world number one, Michael Chang, Goran Ivanisevic and Michael Stich among them. \nMany who have got there are arguably now in Murray's shadow: Pat Rafter, Carlos Moya, Marcelo Rios; definitely Yevgeny Kafelnikov and Thomas Muster; quite possibly Marat Safin and Andy Roddick, Ilie Nastase, Gustavo Kuerten and Lleyton Hewitt too.\nRankings in sport do not always reflect the accepted wisdom. Angelique Kerber may sit above Serena Williams in the women's tennis rankings, but with Williams having won five of their past six meetings and seven times as many career titles, the debate over who is the better player would be short. \nTriathlon's world rankings, based only on the year's World Series results, have Spain's Mario Mola as world number one, when every judge in the sport would define double Olympic champion Alistair Brownlee as the best in the world.\nFew could dispute Nick Faldo's claim to be the best golfer in the world when he topped golf's rankings. A few days after going to number one himself, Ian Woosnam would win the Masters. \nLuke Donald's ascension in 2011 was deserved - he was the first player in history to win the money title on both European and PGA tours in the same season - but because he had never finished as runner-up in a major, let alone won one, there were those who disputed the algorithm's accuracy. So too with Lee Westwood, number one in the same year, still to win a major five years on.\nThe number alone can be less important than the aura a player brings to it. After an unparalleled 12 months - that Davis Cup triumph, winning BBC Sports Personality for the second time, reaching his first French Open final, winning his second Wimbledon, taking Olympic singles gold yet again - Murray has that too.\nAnd this may yet be the start of something even more beautiful, rather than the pinnacle. \nAfter five defeats in the Australian Open final, never will Murray have a better chance of winning it than this January, Federer and Nadal faded, Djokovic - his nemesis in four of those finals - jaded. \nThe French Open title could conceivably be the next unprecedented prize to be pouched. And then Wimbledon again, and why not, after all that has been before?\nIt is dreamy, fanciful stuff. But that has been Murray's motif: ripping up precedent, making the impossible real.\n", "url": "http://www.bbc.com/sport/tennis/37882468", "title": "Andy Murray: Number one ranking 'may be start' of more success for Briton", "tags": ["sport"], "abstract": "Andy Murray becoming world number one could be the start of something even more beautiful, says Tom Fordyce."},

{"text": "The concern that the 2016 US presidential election may be hacked, by Russia or some other bad actor, could hold the same place in history as the Millennium Bug: a whole load of worry over nothing.\n\"Unless the election is extraordinarily close, it is unlikely that an attack will result in the wrong candidate getting elected,\" suggest Matt Bernhard and Professor J Alex Halderman, security experts from the University of Michigan. \nBut they say the risk the election process could be disrupted by hackers should be taken extremely seriously. \nIn the run-up to the big day, the US Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has been carrying out \"cyber hygiene\" tests on voting systems across the country. Officials are confident in the technology, but there are weaknesses that have security professionals standing by on election day ready to step in if irregularities are spotted. \nThe task facing any hacker isn\u2019t insignificant. In the US, voting is done via electronic booths, the vast majority of which are not connected to the internet. \nFurthermore, different states, and areas within those states, use different systems - a logistical headache but something of a security godsend, as a fractured system is much harder to attack en masse. \nBut any would-be election hacker wouldn\u2019t need to target the whole country, or even an entire state. Instead, finding methods to implant minute differences, in areas which promise to be a close-run battle, could both affect the national picture and be difficult to detect. \nAnd so just as candidates target swing states that could go either way, so too could hackers be looking at \"hack states\" to target. \n\"Two out of the last four presidential elections were so close that a change of a few counties in one state would have changed the result of the national presidential election,\" said Andrew Appel, professor of computer science at Princeton University, in an interview with BBC News. \n\"It\u2019s not necessary to cheat in 9,000 different jurisdictions. If the election is close in just one state, changing several tens of thousands of votes might be enough.\" \nProf Appel is part of a team of cybersecurity experts that will be working together on Tuesday to advise election officials on cybersecurity-related matters - helping to identify genuine attacks from, say, just your bog-standard computer glitch, of which there may be plenty. \n\"There may be questions about some piece of machinery that is showing some symptom,\" he explained. \n\"Does that look like a hack or is that normal? That kind of question.\" \nAny security audit, whether it\u2019s to protect a company or a property, focuses on the points of weakness. And in this election, the points of weakness are the electronic voting booths. \nThe greatest concern of the group, which is mostly a mixture of academics and security professionals, is that the security in place on voting machines in some crucial areas just isn't up to scratch. \nFor starters, 10 states use touchscreen-only voting machines, an immediate concern.\n\"You touch the screen and indicate the candidate you want,\u201d explained Prof Appel. \n\"There\u2019s no paper involved, and at the end of the day it indicates how many votes the candidate got. There would be no way to tell if it was done fraudulently.\" \nSeveral security experts have demonstrated how this process can be tampered with, by installing malicious software capable of changing a switching a person's vote once it is in the machine, or by spoofing the smart cards used to identify a voter.\nOther states use what\u2019s known as optical scan voting. That\u2019s when a voter fills in a little oval on a page to cast their ballot. It\u2019s logged by the computer, to make counting much quicker, but also stored as a hard copy. If the computer says the vote goes a certain way and there\u2019s suspicion of shenanigans, it can be crossed checked against the paper copy. \nSo where are the \u201chack states\u201d? \nVerified Voting is an organisation that tracks the use of voting machines, and their security, across the US. It\u2019s a painstakingly put together dataset which gives you an idea of the complexity of the US voting system. \nBy using this resource, and combining it with polling data, Mr Bernhard and Prof Halderman were able to isolate key states with both poor voting booth security and a tight race. \nThey named the states most at risk as Nevada, Pennsylvania, Ohio, and Colorado. \n\"As jurisdictions with close races are most vulnerable to having their results perturbed or cast into doubt, these are the ones to be concerned about,\u201d the researchers wrote. \nMost experts are in agreement that the voting machines provide the biggest risk - the key under the mat for anyone looking for a way in. \nBut hackers may look to other means to agitate the process. \n\"A well resourced adversary, for instance a foreign government, could do plenty of other things to disrupt the election,\u201d wrote Mr Bernhard and Prof Halderman. \n\"Cutting the power to a few key precincts could throw the entire election into chaos.\" \nFurthermore, Prof Appel pointed to previous incidents in which voter registration databases were breached. In September, the FBI urged districts to work with the DHS to ensure their database systems were secure. \n\"The thing that could go wrong is that a voter could show up at the polling place and be told they\u2019re not listed when in fact they should be listed,\u201d Prof Appel explained. \nIn concluding their data analysis on the at-risk states, Mr Bernhard and Prof Halderman offered a summary. \n\u201cThe 2016 election is less secure than it should be. \n\"While we think it\u2019s unlikely that hackers will be able to silently change who wins, attacks that attempt to disrupt or discredit the electoral process in critical states are a distinct possibility.\" \n", "url": "http://www.bbc.com/news/technology-37902613", "title": "US election: Experts keep watch over 'hack states'", "tags": ["tech"], "abstract": "Key swing states are using outdated and insecure voting systems, a source of much concern for cybersecurity experts on polling day."},
{"text": "Broadcaster ITV has forecast a further fall in advertising revenue because of increasing nervousness about the strength of the economy.\nThe company behind the X-Factor and Cold Feet said advertising revenue in the three months 30 September was down 4% on the same quarter last year.\nBut ITV predicted a further 7% fall in the final quarter of 2016 due to \"the political and economic uncertainty\".\nThat would see net advertising revenue fall 3% over the full year, ITV said.\n\"In recent weeks the political and economic uncertainty has increased and we are currently seeing more cautious behaviour by advertisers,\" ITV said in a trading update.\nHowever, the broadcaster said its recent push to boost other revenue streams, such as with content from its production arm ITV Studios, would help to offset the fall in advertising.\nITV's total revenues rose 5% to \u00a32.16bn, but revenue from non-advertising sources rose 15%, helped by a strong performance from its studio business.\nChief executive Adam Crozier said: \"ITV is now a much more balanced and resilient business. Even against the current uncertain economic backdrop, we expect 2016 earnings to be broadly in line with last year.\"\nITV said advertising revenues fell about 11% in October after a jump in the same month last year when it benefitted from the Rugby World Cup.\nThe group boosted viewing figures, with the main ITV channel's share of viewing up 3%. Its online viewing jumped 49% year-on-year in the first nine months of 2016.\nITV's share price rose 1% in early trading, which analysts said was probably due to the revenue fall not being as bad as many experts had forecast.\nTamsin Garrity, media analyst at Jefferies, said the figures were \"slightly better than our cautious scenario\", having pencilled in a drop of more than 8% for the fourth quarter of 2016.\nMeanwhile, George Salmon, equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said: \"Given the current economic uncertainty, it may not be much of a surprise to see the group's customers are pulling their horns in, but it is still not good news for the group. \n\"For the time being, ITV remains the prime place to advertise on a national scale. Coronation Street's status as a national treasure isn't endangered by a weaker economy. \n\"The challenge for the group now is to retain this premier position as Netflix and others grow in the on-demand sphere.

{"text": "HSBC chief executive Stuart Gulliver has urged the government to clarify the status of EU workers in the UK.\nMr Gulliver was asked if the bank planned to move staff from its UK offices following the Brexit vote.\nHe said the government should be given time to negotiate the process of the UK leaving the European Union. \nBut he added: \"The thing I would say that is slightly more urgent is clarity around the status of EU nationals with jobs working in the UK.\"\nOf HSBC's 42,000 staff in the UK, about 2,000 are from the EU.\nThe bank warned in February, when it decided to keep its headquarters in London, that it could transfer some of its workforce to its Paris office if the UK left the EU.\nMr Gulliver's comments came as HSBC reported a sharp fall in third-quarter profits, driven by the sale of its Brazilian business.\nPre-tax profit at Europe's largest bank dropped to $843m (\u00a3678m) in the three months to the end of September, down from $6.1bn in the same period a year ago. \nHSBC took a $1.7bn loss on the sale of its Brazilian unit, and it also pointed to customer compensation in America and currency moves for the fall in profits. \nBut adjusted profit, which excluded one-off costs, rose 7% to $5.6bn, higher than analysts had expected.\nHSBC is the last of the UK's major banks to report quarterly results, after Lloyds, RBS and Barclays posted better-than-expected profits for the period.\nMr Gulliver said: \"Reported profits were down, but adjusted profits were higher than last year's third quarter in all four global businesses and four out of five regions.\" \nDavid Cumming, head of UK equities at Standard Life, said HSBC's results were \"slightly above consensus\", with costs a bit better than expected and its investment banking reasonably strong.\nHSBC shares rose 4% in Hong Kong and London. \nThe headline numbers in bank financial results can often be misleading, and that is the case with HSBC. \nA big fall in reported profits - from about $6bn in the third quarter last year to $800m this - masks what was a reasonable performance from Europe's biggest bank. \nThe headline numbers were held back by a string of one-offs - the fall in value of the bank's own debt, the $1.7bn loss on the sale of the Brazil operations, and some customer compensation payments in America. \nLook past the non-recurring items and profits were slightly better than the same period last year.\nThe bigger issue for most HSBC shareholders is leadership. Douglas Flint, the long-serving chairman, leaves next year, with Stuart Gulliver, chief executive, going in 2019. Investors want reassurance that succession planning is in hand, and that the bank will break with tradition and appoint an outsider to replace Flint. \nHenri de Castries, the French fund manager who already sits on the board, is favourite to take over, but were he to bow out then the bank would face a tricky search for a new leader. \nThere aren't many experienced financial services executives who have both the track record to sit at the top of HSBC, and the stamina to win over the myriad of regulators who will need to approve the appointment.\n", "url": "http://www.bbc.com/news/business-37893503", "title": "HSBC boss urges government clarity on EU workers in the UK", "tags": ["business"], "abstract": "HSBC's chief executive urges the government to clarify the status of EU workers in the UK."}
