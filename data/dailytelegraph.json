However, the actual path of the federal funds rate will depend on the economic outlook as informed by incoming data.\u201d\nWith the election just around the corner, the Fed is typically seen as cautious to act, both for fear of being accused of seeking to influence the vote, and because its response to the election may be different depending on which candidate - Donald Trump or Hillary Clinton - wins, and gets to implement their chosen economic policies.\n\"Assuming Clinton wins, markets are likely to react with relief given expectations of policy continuity. This, coupled with the reasonably firm growth, rising employment and a gradual pick-up in inflation should reinforce market expectations for a December rate hike,\" said economist\u00a0James Knightley at ING.\n\"Should Trump win then this is likely to hurt market sentiment given uncertainty as to what he will actually do when in power. It is hard to imagine the Fed hiking in this environment.\"\nThe rest of the world also watches the Fed's decisions closely. A rising interest rate tends to push up the value of the dollar, as well as encouraging investors to put more money into the US, with the result that funds flow out of other countries.\nOther central banks sometimes follow the Fed's actions themselves. The Bank of England, for example, was expected to raise interest rates this year, as the Fed had broken new post-financial crisis ground with its hike last year - though in the end, the Brexit vote encouraged the UK's central bank to cut its interest rate instead.\n", "title": "Fed holds off hiking rates for now as election looms"},

But nothing heats the insides quicker than a measure of akvavit (otherwise known as\u00a0aquavit).\nAkvavit is a misunderstood niche spirit and unless you know the Nordic drinking and dining scene, chances are you won\u2019t be familiar with it. Now is the time to try it, particularly since it sits nicely with the region\u2019s fashionable fare.\nAkvavit is a spirit distilled with botanicals, most notably caraway and dill. Other ingredients frequently employed include cardamom, cumin, anise, fennel and coriander with lemon or orange peel and even grains of paradise occasionally added. \u00a0\nThe base ingredient for most spirit produced in Sweden and Denmark is grain, but in Norway they tend to favour potatoes and rest the akvavit in casks. The variety of base ingredient alone presents versatility, throw in a range of botanicals and maturation and you start to see the potential, particularly when pairing with cuisine.\nThe dill and coriander are\u00a0obvious accents for simple starters. In crisp, unaged akvavit the drink can cut through the oil of salmon, or more fittingly a gravadlax starter and the botanicals can match the intensity of the ingredients on the plate. Danish producer Aalborg\u2019s is one of the most available brands in the UK, its Taffel variant driven by the caraway (\u00a321.95, Amathus) sweeter and just as useful with herring, or indeed roast pork and pickles.\nThey also have the Dild, as the name suggest with more dill (\u00a329.95, Amathus), which can also work with open sandwiches and, dare we say it, the faithful sm\u00f6rg\u00e5sbord. Both available at amathusdrinks.com, one of the leading retailers for akvavit.\nSk\u00e5ne (\u00a324.64, amathusdrinks.com) is Swedish and a touch smoother, the distillers suggest pairing it with fish soup or crayfish at midsummer parties, but the subtler expression of fennel also makes it useful with a fish main.\u00a0\nAmong the most interesting brands available in the UK is the Norwegian Linie (\u00a332, thewhiskyexchange.com). The company discovered the benefits of ageing by accident when stock sent to the Far East in the 19th century was returned unwanted. Recognising the improved flavour they set about recreating this akvavit and continue to rest the spirit in sherry casks.\nAmathus also stocks Linie Double Cask Madeira (\u00a335.26) and a Linie port wine and the spice, oak and robust warmth of these ensure they work beautifully with the cheese board. Sip all of them neat with Nordic cuisine but the mix of botanicals in akvavit make it an interesting cocktail: try dill akvavit replacing vodka in a twist on the Bloody Mary.\nThis version comes from the excellent Nick Kobbernagel-Hovind who created the drink in Ruby, a bar in Copenhagen and one of the best in the world.\nGlass: Collins\n60ml dill akvavit\u00a0 5ml ruby port 60ml tomato juice 17ml fresh lemon juice 6 dashes Worcestershire sauce 2 heavy dashes Tabasco 1 pinch celery salt 5 grinds of black pepper\n\u2009Pour all the ingredients into a shaker with ice and roll it gently for 6 seconds, then strain into the glass over ice.

As Chicago\u2019s mayor, Richard J. Daley, exclaimed:\u00a0\u201cMy God, they\u2019ve embalmed him before he even died.\u201d Kennedy, in contrast,\u00a0glowed with lusty good health - young, tanned and athletic - like the New\u00a0England princeling he was. I don't need to tell you who won.\u00a0\nClinton\u2019s self-presentation has been as vital a part of her campaign as any other\u00a0candidate\u2019s. More than this, she gets it. A quarter of a century of obsessive\u00a0scrutiny has made her an adept manipulator of this visual language.\u00a0Where once she resented the attention, now she exploits and satirises it. As\u00a0she noted, when her book, Hard Choices,\u00a0was released in spring 2014, her\u00a0favourite alternative title had been: The Scrunchie Chronicles, 112 Countries And\u00a0It\u2019s Still All About The Hair. At the same time, said hair has never looked better,\u00a0and never seemed more articulate of her coming of age as a candidate.\nIn the past, Clinton\u2019s style was subject to dramatic morphings. Back in the\u00a0Seventies, as Hillary Rodham, partner in one of the country\u2019s oldest law firms,\u00a0she favoured an unadorned look: glasses, straight brown hair, cosmetics-free.\u00a0However, as she and her husband endeavoured to conquer public life, slap and\u00a0peroxide became weapons in her arsenal.\nFor the 1992 election, the aspiring first lady countered her reputation for being a\u00a0feminist \u201cball-breaker\u201d with a femininely feathered fringe on a shoulder-length\u00a0coiffure, teamed with pearlised pink lips; becoming a chic crop and scarlet mouth\u00a0once her husband was in office. The Nineties saw her experiment with length,\u00a0wave, blue eye shadow, and her famous headbands (Clinton\u2019s pre-scrunchie\u00a0accessory of choice).\nThese vacillations suggested a woman uncomfortable with the decorative aspect\u00a0of the first lady role, a doer rather than a preener, who only started to find her\u00a0look when this look became about her. Once the focus shifted to her own political\u00a0career, the whole thing became more relaxed.\nAs New York Senator from 2001, and Secretary of State from 2009, Clinton\u2019s\u00a0wielding of hair and make-up became more about variations on a theme: short\u00a0crop, apricot blush, spot of interest about the lips \u2013 be they red, rosy, coral, or the\u00a0telegenic plum created for her by make-up artist Kriss Soterion for the\u00a0Democratic primary debates of 2008.\nIn 2012, as she approached becoming a private citizen for the first time in 30\u00a0years, the hair went long again, a presager of the strategically soft bob with\u00a0honeyed highlights that she has sported on the campaign trail. And - with the\u00a0exception of her dizzy and lipstickless appearance at the 9/11 memorial after\u00a0which her pneumonia was revealed - Clinton has never looked better: happy,\u00a0confident, and truly beautiful.\nFor the television debates, Clinton has accompanied her alternately red, blue and\u00a0white outfitting with a coral-red lipstick, peachy complexion, and black, but in no\u00a0way harsh, eye make-up. It is a simple, but efficient guise that says: \u201cWarm,\u00a0relaxed, and confident with this stuff\u201d.\nThere is a glow about Hillary, despite the arduousness of the campaign. Twitter\u00a0commentators have declared her debate demeanour Christ-like, and there is\u00a0something angelic about her beatific beam. This, not least, when compared with\u00a0a man whose satsuma complexion shade has been satirised as \u201cRage Red\u201d and\u00a0\u201cVeiled White Supremacy,\u201d\u00a0juxtaposed with luminous teeth, and lunatic hair.\u00a0\nAs Hitler recreated himself as a fascist Charlie Chaplin, so Trump has fashioned\u00a0himself as a capitalist clown: a decrepit parody of wealth\u2019s teeth and tan \u2013 the\u00a0bigger the lie, the bigger the hair.

Birthdays, graduation ceremonies and summer holidays, spanning more than 33 years of marriage, are all woven into this rich tapestry of memories. She looks at them and manages a smile.\n\u201cComing home is very hard. It is a beautiful house, but every corner of it is breathing Dave. It is hard to even walk in.\u201d\nArmstrong, 68, is dealing with an unimaginable tragedy. Three months ago, while the couple were at their holiday home in southern France, Wood disappeared without a trace.\nOn the morning of Aug 2, the 61-year-old telecoms engineer set off to walk part of the mountain route between the village of Marie in Alpes-Maritimes and Clans, a small town about 6km to the south \u2013 but never returned.\u00a0\nIt is a straightforward and scenic hike, past rocky outcrops, streams and forest, and one he enjoyed most days, walking as far as he could manage, before turning back. No one has ever gone missing in the area before and the fact that such an extensive search has unearthed not one shred of evidence as to his whereabouts is, say police, highly unusual.\n\u201cHe knew the area extremely well and knew the people,\u201d says Armstrong, an artist and painter. The couple had stayed in their house, just above Marie, for six weeks of every summer for the last six years. \u201cThe villagers absolutely took us in. Dave was well known. He is a big man with a mass of white hair. He is funny, very loving, warm and a fantastic father. People who know him really love him.\u201d\nSitting on the sofa of their home in Woodbridge, Suffolk, she cannot bring herself to use anything other than the present tense.\u00a0\nTo add to the confusion, Wood was in good health, apart from a recent diagnosis of elevated blood pressure \u2013 which prompted his decision to walk more and get fit \u2013 and a brief bout of labyrinthitis, an inner ear infection that can cause nausea, dizziness and problems with balance and hearing.\u00a0\nWood had been gone for about an hour when Armstrong first called his mobile to see where he was. Nothing seemed amiss; he said he was on his way back, about half an hour away. Half an hour passed and she rang again. He told her he was tired and had taken a rest. Again, he said he was about half an hour away.\n\u201cHe was supposed to be back by 2.30pm in the afternoon,\u201d recalls Armstrong. \u201cHe had a conference call booked. He had to be back. It is completely odd that he went so far.\u201d\nThat was the last time the couple spoke. After that, Wood\u2019s phone rang without answer.\nA large-scale search, headed up by Lieutenant-colonel Dominique Blasius, of the Alpes-Maritimes police department, lasted 10 days and included officers, abseil teams, hundreds of local volunteers, sniffer dogs and a helicopter. Wood had been carrying two phones \u2013 an iPhone and a French mobile. Police attempted to use his iPhone signal to geolocate him but, because he hadn\u2019t used it that day, an exact location hadn\u2019t been logged. The best police could do was narrow it to two remote areas the size of a kilometre each. Nothing was found.\nHis elder son Danny, 32, a product designer in Brighton, who immediately flew out with his brother to help with the search, put out a plea on Facebook for information.\n\u201cIf he fell on the path or just off the path, he would have been found,\u201d he wrote, in a post that has since been shared more than 2,000 times. \u201cThe forest nearby is very dense and, although he is an inquisitive person, he would not put himself in any unnecessary risk, so walking deep into it seems highly unlikely, especially as he knew that he had to be back home soon, these areas have also been heavily searched.\u201d\nIt was discovered that a couple on a motorbike had passed Wood on the path to Clans, when he stopped them to ask the direction of Marie. For some reason, he had been heading the opposite way. It is thought this was the last time he was seen.\u00a0\nAfter 10 days, the couple\u2019s younger son, Richard, 30, an engineer, had the bright idea to buy a drone to better scour ground that was less easily accessible by foot. After almost three weeks, however, the family returned to the UK, none the wiser.\u00a0\nToday, Armstrong has the look of a woman haunted by grief. Her eyes well with tears but she is determined not to be broken by the weight of either expectation or despair.\n\u201cIt is pulling us apart,\u201d she says. \u201cWe don\u2019t know if he is dead or alive. I think we all fear the worst but there is no proof. There is nothing. I keep asking, 'Dave, if you have died send me a message. Tell me something. I have got to know.\u2019 It is awful. It is eating us up. Danny, Richard and I are in a parallel universe. They are going to work, and that is helping them I think, but our heads are continually somewhere else. All the time I am thinking about him.\u201d\nThe couple met 40 years ago in Cambridge: Armstrong was working as an art therapist, Wood was doing a PhD. She calls it \u201cfriendship at first sight\u201d. It wasn\u2019t until they were both single, five years later, that he dropped everything and travelled to Spain to be with her. After that they \u201cshared everything\u201d. \u00a0\nTheories as to what happened to him abound. Did he fall and hurt himself? Did he have heatstroke and get lost? The possibility that Wood was involved in something dubious has inevitably crossed her mind.\u00a0\n\u201cBut none of those things makes sense. I heard all his conference calls. He was a very honest and honourable man. He wouldn\u2019t get himself into something strange. He just wouldn\u2019t. There was a time when we thought, was it foul play? Has someone hurt him by mistake?\u201d\nLieutenant-colonel Blasius is aware time is against them. \u201cHowever, we are not abandoning the search and I remain firmly convinced that David Wood suffered a cerebral malaise, became disoriented, and is still somewhere between the village of Clans and that of Marie,\u201d he says.\nHe has employed unorthodox methods of scanning the terrain, including a diviner and a spiritual medium.\u00a0\nOne hypothesis is that Wood\u2019s labyrinthitis had recurred, disorientating him and driving him deep into the mountains. In which case, he could be still be alive, lost in the denser forested areas.\n\u201cIf he is, I dread to think what kind of state he is in,\u201d says Armstrong.\nHospitals as far as Italy have been handed his description and now boar hunters are back out, combing the mountains, the hope is that his whereabouts will become known. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\nFor now, Armstrong has no plans to return to France \u2013 \u201cthere is no point\u201d \u2013 and believes her energy is best directed into generating publicity around his disappearance.\nI remark on the incredible resilience and strength of resolve she has displayed throughout our conversation.\n\u201cI have got to,\u201d she replies. \u201cIf I collapse under all this, I might not be able to get back up. It is so terrible and there is no end in sight. It is not like the person you love most in the world has been killed by a car and then you grieve and go through all the process of grieving. I can\u2019t do that. I don\u2019t know if I am grieving.\u201d\nFor more information visit:\u00a0www.facebook.com/TrouveDavidWood\n", "title": "The real life Missing: My husband went for a walk on holiday and never came back"},

In fact I had \u2013 and still have \u2013 the same conversation over and over again when I tell people that I have written about this topic. I could script it, and it goes exactly like this\u2026\nAn expert I spoke to in the late 90s\u00a0opined that the situation for male victims then was much the same as it had been for women thirty years earlier. Around the same time, a senior policeman told me that we shouldn\u2019t talk about male victims for fear that it takes the focus away from women.\nI continued to research, speaking to both male and female victims and found that just as the types of abuse reported by men are similar to the types of abuse reported by women, the impact of that abuse is much the same. What appears to be different is an unwillingness on the part of many men to accept that what has happened is actually abuse, many of them seeing it as something \u201cthat just happens\u201d.\nPart of male socialisation and the sexist stereotypes society imposes on our men and boys is to \u201cgrow a pair\u201d, \u201cman up\u201d, or \u201ctake it like a man\u201d. Therefore, it could be argued, men\u2019s weakness is their fa\u00e7ade of strength.\nAccording to the Office of National Statistics (ONS) and the 2014/15 British Crime Survey, male victims (29pc) are more than twice as likely as women (12pc) to not tell anyone about the partner abuse they are experiencing, and only 10% of male victims will tell the police (26pc\u00a0women). These figures show that domestic abuse is, in general, underreported, and that surely calls into question the current trend towards a gendered approach.\nOver the years that I\u2019ve been observing this issue, the conversation has moved from being about domestic abuse to stopping violence against women and children. A laudable aim, for who in their right mind wouldn\u2019t want that to happen? My concern \u2013 and one that is shared by people who work with abused men \u2013 is that it appears that in this narrative male victims are being sidelined.\nIn 2015, 109,000 men reported to English and Welsh police forces that they were victims of domestic abuse, which constitutes 23pc of the overall total. This is not an insignificant number. Another study found that while men are eight times more likely to commit overall violence than women, there is gender parity in partner abuse. More worrying is the fact that more than 70pc of non-reciprocal violence is instigated by women. Things have changed, and not in a good way.\nGiven that the research indicates only 12% of male victims contact the police, it's probably\u00a0safe to assume the real figures are greater.\u00a0 Take those numbers and consider the help available for men. Twenty organisations offer refuge or safe house provision for male victims in the UK \u2013 a total of 82 spaces, of which 24 are dedicated to male DV victims only (the rest being for victims of either gender). For female victims, there close to 7,500 spaces for women and their children.\nSo where do we as a society go from here? We need an open and honest debate. We need to encourage all victims to come forward and seek help. We need to acknowledge that the barriers abused men face are not only attributable to a lack of visible and accessible support services, and the marginalisation of men in the public narrative of domestic abuse, but are also related to sexist stereotypes of what it means to be a \u201creal man\u201d.\nI believe we need to follow the lead of the female victims of domestic abuse who have come to me after reading my novel,\u00a0A Suitable Lie. They see this book as a commentary on domestic abuse and the horrors it inflicts. What they\u00a0don\u2019t\u00a0see is gender. They see violence and its impact; they feel listened to; and they feel hope that together \u2013 women and men \u2013 we can rid our society of this scourge.\nPerhaps that generosity of spirit and empathy is where the experts need to go. Because, while they argue about who is doing what to whom and in what numbers,\u00a0people\u00a0are being hurt by other\u00a0people. And\u00a0people\u00a0and their children are not receiving the help and support they need.\nA Suitable Lie is published by Orenda Books, \u00a38.99\n", "title": "Until we treat male and female domestic abuse victims the same, we'll never be rid of it"},

This is neither a One Nation approach, nor does it meet the Prime Minister\u2019s test of being \"for everyone\".\nSince June 23rd, our decision to leave the EU is being misinterpreted in all sorts of ways - from a justification for bizarre policies on reporting foreign workers, to a mandate to withdraw entirely from the European Single Market or from\u00a0free trade. Clearly voters in the referendum rejected \"business as usual\", but they did not reject the need for government to get to grips with the deficit. That was the central plank of the Conservative Manifesto which delivered a majority government just 18 months ago. The very first pledge in that manifesto was to \u201ckeep our economy secure by running a surplus so that we start paying down our debts\u201d.\nSpeaking to voters on both sides of the referendum debate, it is clear to me that the decision for many was less about the impact of Brexit on them, but more about their children and grandchildren. Voters rightly thought about the future and how Britain can be most successful in a globalised world, in a way that will deliver that most basic of human desires \u2013 for those who come after us to have greater opportunities than we did. Abandoning plans to deliver a budget surplus as the Chancellor has suggested does nothing to help achieve this.\nI have just turned 30, and it doesn't surprise me that the IFS found in recent research that my generation are half as wealthy as those born a decade earlier were at the same stage of life. People born in the 1980s are the first generation to earn less than those born in the previous decade; we\u2019ve been locked out of the property market which has delivered huge capital wealth to those before us; we face higher housing and rent costs; and we have far less generous pension schemes.\u00a0\nMore young people today believe they will start their own business than own their own home; while the start of that statement gives me great hope, the latter half is a disaster.\nMy generation, and to an even greater extent the one behind, face the triple-whammy of exorbitant student debt burdens, compulsory pension contributions, and higher taxes that deplete our incomes and ability to save. We live in a world of skewed transport costs, where it's cheaper for us to jet across Europe for a weekend in the sun than to travel home by train to see our parents. For the Chancellor to turn around post-EU referendum and land us with even greater debts to clear in the future, while continuing to protect pensioners with a triple-lock and universal benefits is simply unethical.\nAs the Chancellor himself said last at the Conservative Party conference in Birmingham \u201cThe deficit remains unsustainable\u2026. And piling up debt for our children and our grandchildren to pay off is not only unsustainable... it\u2019s unfair\u2026 and it\u2019s downright un-Conservative.\u201d\nPublic Sector debt has trebled in ten years and now stands at 84 per cent of GDP, a figure set to grow by a further \u00a355bn this financial year. Eight years after the financial crash, in 2016 we will borrow \u00a31,700 for every person in the UK in work. It is worth remembering that the last time the public finances were in surplus was in 2001, in the last year of Ken Clarke\u2019s financial plans that were carried over into the early years of New Labour.\u00a0\nSo while we must invest in major infrastructure projects that secure our economic future, from HS2 to Crossrail 2, Heathrow (and for that matter Gatwick) expansion, renewal energy projects, upgrading roads across the regions, and build the new homes we desperately need, there is no reason to do this off the backs of the next generation. Borrowing to build new homes young people cannot afford, with debt we expect those same young people to pay back, is far from a sustainable future that works for everyone.\nPhilip Hammond must stick to his predecessor's plans for a surplus. With employment levels at a record high, more businesses operating in the UK than ever before, inflation low, and interest rates on the floor, he has a moral duty to act now to secure younger Britons' future. If he fails to act in a way that delivers generational equality, he'll not only be storing up crippling debts for millennials:\u00a0he'll be storing an electoral crisis for the Conservative Party.\nOwen Meredith is Deputy Chairman on the Tory Reform Group\n", "title": "Don't let up on cutting the deficit, Chancellor, or you will betray millennials"},

But tourists and people on work visas have been equally able to break the terms of their visas because the Home Office for many years had no way of knowing who had left the country.\nThe inability to count arrivals and departures has been a major hindrance to the UK\u2019s non-EU immigration policy since exit checks were abolished in 1998 on the grounds that they were ineffective.

By this stage I resembled nothing so much as a mortally wounded animal, howling to be put out of its misery. Yet,\u00a0the anaesthetist warned me that the\u00a0magic pain relief bullet he was about to fire up my spine might later cause me a headache.\n\u2018A headache?\u2019 I wanted to yell - but couldn\u2019t, because I\u2019d long since lost the power of speech.\u00a0\u2018I\u2019m in so much pain my body\u2019s about to give out, and my mind gave up hours ago when I started moaning \u201cI \u2013 can\u2019t \u2013 cope\".\u2019\nA sore\u00a0head\u00a0is one of the few potential side effects of having an epidural anaesthesia, which numbs the pain nerves during labour. It can also, it is said, decelerate the birth itself - as the numbness it induces can make it harder to push the baby out.\nPerhaps. But my second baby popped out in three heaves -\u00a0despite me topping up my epidural medicine as often as the machinery would allow me. \u00a0\nSo why, then, do so many women feel ike availing themselves of this - or other effective pain relief medication during labour - is tantamount to surrender; even failure?\nA 2014 study of women\u2019s experiences of maternity care in England found that only 29 per cent\u00a0have an epidural for pain relief during labour. Why so few? We're encouraged to have our babies\u00a0as \u2018naturally\u2019 as possible. But, surely,\u00a0giving birth, by any means, is the most natural thing in the world and cannot be made \u2018unnatural\u2019 - no matter what interventions we might require to ease the process along?\nYet, a\u00a0harmful mythology surrounding the benefits of \u2018natural\u2019 birth persists. Goodness knows women aren\u2019t supposed to do anything else naturally, be it ageing,\u00a0growing body hair or even going make-up free. But when it comes to childbirth, we are encouraged to simply \u2018breathe through the pain.\u2019\n(Of course, before the advent of modern medicine, far more women died during labour, which was arguably also very natural. We draw the line at allowing this to happen now.)\nIn my pregnancy yoga class, the teacher read us grateful letters from former pupils who had supposedly used just their \u2018golden thread breaths\u2019 to get them over the threshold during childbirth. Hypnobirthing, meanwhile, blithely assures women that \u2018in the absence of fear and tension...severe pain does not have to be an accompaniment of labour.\u2019 \u00a0\nI hate to break it to any women planning to procreate, but in my limited experience, it does. \u00a0\nWe just don\u2019t talk about it very much. As with many other things that happen to women, it is not the done thing to go on about it. Those of us who have been through it perhaps don\u2019t want to put others off. (My own mother promised me childbirth was \u2018lovely\u2019. I duly screamed at her after my son was born: \u2018It wasn\u2019t!\u2019)\nBut there also exists a cultural conspiracy to hush things up;\u00a0to primly draw a curtain around the woman screaming on the labour ward and pretend her pain is less real if we just don\u2019t mention it.\nA Royal Society of Medicine meeting will be advised next month that women should feel no shame for requesting pain relief during labour and that medication like\u00a0epidurals have\u00a0no ill effect. It\u2019s a departure that can\u2019t come soon enough.\nDoctors will also say women have been misled into thinking a painful birth is better for them and the baby. Such demystification is long overdue and an important first step towards tackling the unjust stigma that still surrounds the woman who has \u2018given in\u2019 and asked for some proper pain relief.\nAfter giving birth to my daughter six months ago, the midwife told me: \u2018You didn\u2019t need that epidural. You\u2019d been doing really well.\u2019\nDear midwife, I did.

From Wolf Hall to The Lost Prince and Victoria, I\u2019m so glued to the box I can almost lick the screen. So imagine my pain when I realised I can\u2019t share in the orb-tactic experience that is The Crown: a ten-part series covering the modern royal family, which is expected to run to sixty episodes eventually and has already cost \u00a3100 million.\nWhy am I an exile from this small screen bliss? Because, unlike half the nation, I don\u2019t have Netflix. And it\u2019s my own puritanical fault. Something at the core of me objects to the subscription model, where TV programmes are streamed to the customer on demand. A schoolmarm side of me dislikes the idea of the impatient, voracious, sensation-bloated viewer being gratified whenever they like. Perhaps because I know that needy person could so easily (will?) be me.\nI still have a sentimental 20th-Century attachment to drama as Event TV; the notion that a vast proportion of the population will sit down and tune in to exactly the same gripping programme at precisely the moment as their neighbours, friends and family \u2013 that the next day your colleagues will talk through the screening with the certainty you watched it too. Later, in the pub, regulars will discuss an unseen plot twist over their pints and everyone will feel they have a small stake in family entertainment.\nExtraordinary to think it now, but on Christmas Day 1986 just over 30 million people tuned in to EastEnders to see Dirty Den hand over divorce papers to his wife Angie. In the US, the \u201cWho Shot JR?\u201d episode of Dallas attracted a mind-boggling 90 million viewers. Clearly, quite a few people cared more about these characters than they did about their own family. Woe betide the unworldly fool who phoned at a key moment: they would be excommunicated for life.\nMany of my classmates in the 1980s channelled their teenage passion and anxiety into TV soaps. One friend was so distraught when Bobby Ewing was shot that she kept bursting into tears for a fortnight. Another became so addicted to Neighbours that when she started medical training, she fell swiftly in love with an anaesthetist, who was the only other doctor at Guy\u2019s to sneak off at teatime for a dose of Scott and Charlene.\nI was more of a BBC drama junkie myself. My recent delight at The Night Manager zoomed me back to the first, great addictive Le Carr\u00e9 adaptation, Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy (1979), starring Alec Guinness. When it was on, a spaceship full of aliens could have landed in the garden and my mum and I wouldn\u2019t have budged. We needed our fix.\nOf course, Saturday night light entertainment was the top communal experience for decades. It seems apt that Terry Johnson\u2019s play Dead Funny, which explores a fan club\u2019s obsession with comedians of the golden TV era, was revived this week at London\u2019s Vaudeville theatre. I watched it on Thursday and laughed like a drain, while wondering what anyone under 30 would make of it. How could today\u2019s young understand a world in which grown men\u2019s emotions were fixed in aspic in the 1970s, because they\u2019d watched too much Benny Hill and Sid James? But it makes perfect sense to anyone who gets misty-eyed at the mere mention of \u201cErnie\u2019s ghostly gold-tops a rattling in their crate.\u201d\nNetflix, Amazon and the iPlayer have changed the landscape of our televisual viewing. No longer will we idly watch something unfamiliar just because it\u2019s on the box and then find ourselves seduced by Etruscan history. Boredom first drove me to One Man and His Dog, but respect and Collie-love kept me watching. My knowledge of the classic cinema canon comes almost entirely from Sunday afternoon viewing, when the only alternative TV was sport.\nHow else would I have watched Ice Cold in Alex fifteen times? Or Went the Day Well, Random Harvest, Whisky Galore, or Black Narcissus? And I\u2019m grateful to all those times the afternoon\u2019s viewing was so deathly I had to read a book, or climb a tree instead. My children will never know the quiet despair of tuning on the box to find it\u2019s Crown Court and so opt for Jane Austen instead.\nToday\u2019s subscription audiences have their own narrow taste bounced back at them. The top sites have sophisticated algorithms to make sure you\u2019re fed more of what you think you crave; \u201cCritically \u2013 acclaimed Emotional Underdog Movies and \u201cVisually Striking Foreign Nostalgic Dramas\u201d are two real genres from over 75,000 on the Netflix database. An article in the Atlantic found that in 2014 the top two Netflix US viewing topics were \u201cAbout Marriage\u201d and \u201cAbout Royalty\u201d. The Crown is no accident of the dramatist\u2019s imagination. It\u2019s evolutionary science, or the TV equivalent of IVF: put the two strongest themes in a test-tube and hatch a sure-fire winner.\nAnd while that\u2019s well and good for undemanding, mainstream viewing, can you imagine anyone, ever, saying they\u2019d like a comedy about three celibate men cohabiting on a small island off the Irish coast?

But Bernard-Henri Levy, writing dispatches from the front line of the battle for Mosul, is not unusual. Kurdish Peshmerga units are full of embedded Western journalists and this isn\u2019t a coincidence. It\u2019s a canny move by the Kurdish Regional Government in Erbil to ensure the world knows about the Kurds\u2019 role in the offensive to retake Mosul, Iraq\u2019s third city, from Isil.\nYet while it makes for good reading, the bravery of the Kurdish Peshmerga (\u201cthose who stand in the face of death\u201d) forces is not actually the most notable aspect of the operation. More remarkable is the level of cooperation between the Kurds troops and the Iraqi national army.\nTwo years after Iraq\u2019s military turned tail and fled Mosul, leaving its residents to suffer under Isil\u2019s black flags, the same force is now leading the charge to retake the city. Better still, the operation has warmed relations between Baghdad and Kurdish leaders. The entente is fragile, but if it can hold, a stable Iraq might just emerge.\nThe operation has been set up carefully, with Western help. Iraqi troops have promised to stay in line and respect Kurdish territory. In turn, the Peshmerga have promised they won\u2019t enter Mosul. That part was easy, says Mike Knights, a fellow at the Washington Institute, because the Kurds have no desire to repeat the mistakes made in 2003, when they conquered Mosul from Sunni Baathists, looted everything then tried to rule over a hostile population.\nThis time, the Kurds have their eyes on a bigger prize. In August, Erbil and Baghdad finally signed a deal to share revenues from oil production around Kirkuk, a city home to a large Kurdish population \u2013 and Iraq\u2019s richest oil reserves. Erbil badly needs the cash: since oil prices plunged, the Kurdish government has only been able to pay about half of the wages owed to its bloated civil service, according to Renad Mansour of Chatham House.\nIn Kirkuk, a special accommodation has been reached. Baghdad pays the salaries and the Peshmerga provide the security. Oil revenues are split fifty-fifty. That might not be a glorious step towards the independence the Kurds crave, but until an upturn in the oil price, that ambition is on the back burner. In addition to the oil deal, Baghdad has also been sharing Western-provided weaponry with the Peshmerga and including Kurdish officials in international summits.\nThe Mosul offensive is helping to strengthen this trust, but victory in the battle will bring two dangers. With Isil defeated, there will be a power vacuum in the city. Two other players will be trying to influence what happens next: Mosul\u2019s Sunni population and Iraq\u2019s Shia militias, who have mostly been kept out of the battle so far.\nMosul\u2019s Sunnis could make a strong case to be given more autonomy, along the lines of Kurdish Iraq. Iraq\u2019s constitution in theory grants them a large degree of self-governance, but it was never honoured by the previous regime in Baghdad. The city has been through hell under Isil and the coming battle could be even worse. It\u2019s also home to many former Baathists who supported Saddam Hussein. So even if they are granted more autonomy, it\u2019s not clear how its factions will agree to share power peacefully.\nAn even bigger challenge are the Shia militias. These bands are full of extremist, anti-Sunni soldiers and are backed by Iran, which is working to keep Iraq weak and unstable. If Iran gets its way and can boost the power of its cronies in Baghdad, led by former Prime Minister Nouri al-Malaki, Iraq could fall back into chaos.\nAvoiding this fate will take patience, military strength and clever strategy. The West must keep together its coalition of European and US forces aiding Iraq\u2019s shaky government. But it must also help persuade Baghdad to accept reality and give the country\u2019s Sunnis more autonomy in a proper federal system. In order to hold Iraq together, its leaders must be prepared to split it up.\nThis will take years, not months, but it\u2019s a prize worth fighting for. If Iraq\u2019s sects and ethnic groups can find a way to share power, the country could become an example to the whole region.

I would encourage my supporters to back Peter Whittle, who I think would make a fantastic leader of the party.\"\nMr Kassam worked as chief aide to Mr Farage until he\u00a0stepped down after\u00a0being accused of turning the party\u00a0leader\u00a0into a \"thin-skinned, aggressive man\" who was making Ukip a \"personality cult\".

The top of the party is treating this like a coronation:\u00a0I am not satisfied about the integrity of the process, and having put a number of complaints in to the party chairman.\u00a0I was disappointed that incidents whereby Members of the European Parliament are using party databases to effectively campaign against me \u2013 ostensibly against the rules \u2013 were not challenged.\n\"2.

Fundraising:\u00a0While we raised enough for our deposit, and got over 200 assentors to my nomination, we could not raise enough for this to be more than a digital campaign run from SW1, and to not feature at events all around the country would have made me a hypocrite, given how much I criticise the establishment for ignoring the country.\"\nUkip has found itself with another leadership contest on its hands after the sudden resignation of newly-elected leader Diane James after just 18 days in post.\nFormer leader Mr Farage then returned, assuming the role of acting leader, but it has now emerged that a new leader will be in placed before Christmas.\nBut Steven Woolfe, the front-runner to replace Mr Farage and Ms James, dramatically ended his leadership campaign and resigned from the party, claiming it was \"ungovernable\" without Mr Farage at the helm.\nThe deadline for nominations closes at noon today.\nWho could be the party's next leader? Here are some of the potential contenders.\nWidely seen as a good media performer who has burnished her reputation with numerous appearances on BBC1's Question Time, the 51-year-old former journalist was unable to stand in the summer's election because she had been suspended from the party over comments she made suggesting Mr Farage was a \"divisive\" figure. Previously a Farage favourite, she was his choice as interim leader after his swiftly-retracted resignation in 2015. The suspension has since been lifted, clearing the way for her\u00a0leadership bid.

Many observers were surprised when the 39-year-old history lecturer announced he would not stand in the race to succeed Mr Farage. He is regarded as one of the potential candidates most likely to be able to capitalise on the high level of support for Leave among Labour's traditional working-class strongholds in the North.\nFormer party director Lisa Duffy is chief of staff to Ukip MEP Patrick O'Flynn and had Ms Evans' support in this summer's election, in which she came second to Ms James with 4,591 votes, many drawn from the anti-Farage wing of the party.\nHaving come second in the leadership contest she may feel she could be in with a chance of taking the role the second time around. The ex-TK Maxx store manager previously\u00a0sparked controversy for her comments in which she called for a \"total ban\" on Muslim faith schools, while insisting she is \"not far-Right\".\nPeter Whittle was Ukip's candidate for the 2016 London mayoral election and is a member of the London Assembly.

We have an equivalent standard to the American with Disabilities Act which determines how long the doors should stay open, so there is already a built-in delay.\n\"It might be that people have noticed a bigger delay in some lifts and thought that the close-door buttons are not working.\"\nApex Lifts, London\u2019s biggest lift manufacturing and servicing company, also said the systems work differently to in the US.\u00a0\u00a0\n\u201cOver in the UK we normally tend to wire up the buttons so they do actually work,\u201d said a spokesman. \u201cThey are normally most common in places like multi-story car parks.\u201d\nHowever it would not be the first time that buttons have turned out to be dummies.\u00a0In 2013 it emerged that many buttons on pedestrian crossings in Britain are fakes, with traffic controlled by an automated system rather than the request of walkers.\nThousands of junctions across the country operate on a Split Cycle Offset Optimisation Technique.\nIt works by \u201cvehicle detectors\u201d adjusting the lengths of time between the traffic being stopped depending on how heavily the roads are being used at that time.\nThe system was developed by the Transport Research Laboratory in Wokingham and has a maximum time of two minutes that people will wait for the green man.\nThe junctions operation from 7am to midnight in some areas and the waiting times vary by time of day and the location, but the revelations have angered some who feel pedestrians are being tricked by the fake, or placebo, buttons.\nIn Edinburgh between 50 and\u00a060 of 300 junctions have crossings where the green man comes on automatically, while in Manchester 40 per cent of the buttons are placebos and don\u2019t need to be pressed to stop the traffic at busy times.\nThe automated system can also have added benefits. In 2012 Transport for London changed the setting at a crossing in north London after Orthodox Jews told them they were not allowed to operate electronic machinery on the Sabbath.\nThe change means that from sundown on Friday to sundown on Saturday the pedestrian crossing operates on an automated programme rather than via pressing the button.\nThe door buttons on the London Underground also no longer work.\u00a0\n", "title": "Close-door buttons DO work in British lifts\u2026 but not in US elevators"},

For that reason, we undertake an audit, to help understand what we most deeply appreciate and why.\nOne thing we can agree on. As wide as the choice of names is the menu of criteria. When Telegraph Sport reporters began nominating candidates, from W G Grace to the Brownlee brothers, it became obvious that the reasons for choosing this or that athlete were almost as numerous as the contenders themselves.\nOur cricket correspondent, Scyld Berry, for instance, argued for W G Grace on the basis that affecting society and changing the game itself is a vital measure.\nNaturally there was a tumble of other yardsticks, from pure talent, to longevity, to perseverance, to numerical benchmarks to charisma.\nThe ability to quell personal demons also popped up as an achievement worth recognising. All the while, the personal memories of each judge were calling up from their well to shape our choices.\nSuccess comes in British sport these days in a cascade; so much so that we have come to expect it.\nAndy Murray\u2019s first Wimbledon title felt like a catharsis that allowed Fred Perry to finally rest in peace. His second, this summer, was a triumphant affirmation of his talent and strength of character. It was, in that sense, unsurprising. A double Wimbledon men\u2019s champion? Consumption of a couple of jugs of Pimm\u2019s would have been required back in the 1980s or 90s even to imagine such a thing.\nWith Murray, you can throw in a US Open title and successive Olympic golds, as well as his colossal contribution to Britain\u2019s return from the wastelands of the Davis Cup. Through application and willpower, Murray escaped a place in history as the player who was good but not great, forever doomed to fall behind Novak Djokovic, Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal. Murray\u2019s career is a study in refusing to accept easy money for finishing fourth.\nSee? Mention any big name and the brain starts charging down avenues of assessment, stopping to look at character as much as conquest.\nMost bizarre of all is that the picture just keeps improving. London 2012 was an epic mission accomplished, in medal terms, but then along came Rio 2016, where Britain became the first country to reach the podium more times than they had in a home Olympics four years previously.\nWhich is where we might bring in gender, and the probable imbalance in the final 100 between men and women: a disparity that reflects huge socio-economic factors but also the familiar category error of comparing women\u2019s sport to men\u2019s.\nMany of the derogatory comments about women\u2019s activities stem from the foolish premise that Rebecca Adlington would lose a swimming race with Adam Peaty, or that Virginia Wade would have been blown away by Murray.\nJess Ennis-Hill, Denise Lewis and Katherine Grainger compete against the best of their sex in their chosen sport, and the entertainment value from that is just as high. Of all the benefits of Britain\u2019s Olympic success, the advances made by women\u2019s sport is the most valuable.\nThe escalation of triumphs has left few sports behind, most notably football, where England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland have between them reached one international final in 66 years of trying, though Wales\u2019 march to the semi-finals of Euro 2016 was a notable progression.\nFifty years on from Sir Bobby Charlton and Bobby Moore \u2013 1966 and all that \u2013 there is no subsequent English footballer demanding inclusion in the top 10 of a top 100. Across the other nations cases can be made for George Best, Ryan Giggs, Gareth Bale and Kenny Dalglish. There is no disguising the truth, however, that football is going to be poorly represented, given its hold on our everyday agenda.\nCharlton fills the roles of Munich air disaster survivor, World Cup and European Cup winner, and elder statesman of the English game. That CV takes some beating. It also introduces a note of conduct, or integrity, which takes us off the straight road of counting caps, titles and medals.\n'How we feel\u2019 about someone in sport shapes the list-making. In an age when looking up to superstar athletes is ever more complicated, those we consider to have affirmed our world view, or just made us feel better about life, are bound to shine more brightly.\nIf sport is essentially human struggle - against the opponent, nature, the clock, or against oneself \u2013 the eye will be pulled towards those who suffered for their art. In rugby union Jonny Wilkinson\u2019s self-pummelling perfectionism refused to give him a break even after he kicked the winning drop goal in the 2003 Rugby World Cup final in Sydney.\nFor many that moment of self-realisation would have blown away the pain forever. But it stalked Wilkinson for the rest of his career, and into retirement, where his confessions shed new light on the obsessive nature of successful sportsmen and women: the hidden price they pay.\nMartin Johnson, on the other hand, was Wilkinson\u2019s antithesis: a mighty leader who considered it his brief to conquer often and emote as little as possible. Away from England, others who consider rugby their favourite sport will prefer to reward the brilliant creativity of the Wales sides of the early 1970s. For a mass of observers, the pinnacle in sport is to be able to bamboozle: to deliver the shock of the unexpected. A case in point: the panache that elevated a Gareth Edwards or Phil Bennett above the bump and grind.\nBut still with struggle, sheer physical sacrifice, often called courage, takes sport into that wider realm where spectators identify games and pastimes as metaphors for life. So when Tony 'A P\u2019 McCoy wins 20 consecutive National Hunt jockey titles while smashing just about every bone in his body, endurance and indomitability become a daily spectacle we have only to travel to Fakenham or Taunton to examine. There are few areas of life where you can turn a Monday afternoon into a study of the human spirit (while also profiting from it, if you back a winner).\nBoxing is another sport that takes people to places most of us would have no wish to go, to face the fists and the brutal intent of another. On that path to the outer reaches, Joe Calzaghe and Lennox Lewis are among those who matched technical skill with bravery to leave an indelible mark in history.\nEqually the triathlete Brownlee brothers climbed higher ground when Alistair helped Jonny over the line this year in Mexico: an immortal study not only of Corinthianism but familial solidarity.\nThis search is not confined to the household names, the headline-hogging 'mainstream\u2019 sports. Nick Faldo and Ian Botham will have to fight it out with lower-profile champions. Again the sheer breadth of achievement is a major part of this story.\nWho would have thought that guilt trips could be such a part of this search. 'Who can we put in\u2019 has become 'Who had we better not leave out.\u2019 There are some truly great Olympians for example who are sometimes less swiftly acknowledged than the cyclists or stars of track and field. Ben Ainslie, a seaborne warrior, is one.\nSo the precise order of the top 100 is arguably less important than the process of working out how we measure success, which steers us from thought into the deeper mine of feeling. It might not be too grand to say it will tell us a lot about how we see life.\n\u00a0\n", "title": "The search for the UK's greatest ever sportsperson starts now"},

Sadly, however - and for the first time in five editions - there were no female sailors departing from Les Sables d\u2019Olonne on Sunday morning.\nIt is a huge shame. You think about some of the famous women who have competed in past editions; Isabelle Autissier, Catherine Chabaud, Sam Davies. Most of all Ellen Macarthur, of course, who as a 24 year-old finished second back in 2001, still the best ever result by a British sailor in the Vend\u00e9e Globe and one that made her a household name on both sides of the Channel, earning her the nickname \u2018la petite anglaise'.\nSo why are there no female sailors in this race?\nRest assured it has nothing to do with the physical nature of the event. In my opinion, the appetite is there, but timing plays an important role. Many of those who might have considered entering were part of Team SCA, the first all-female Volvo Ocean Race Team in over a decade. There simply wasn\u2019t the time to put a challenge together after last year's Volvo Ocean Race.\nI am, though, confident we will see plenty of women in the next edition. There were five female sailors in this year\u2019s La Solitaire du Figaro, which is seen as the feeder series to the Vend\u00e9e Globe. I think at least three of them could enter in 2020, and I know there are others who would love another crack, including me. Who knows what the future may hold.\nIt actually feels odd for this Vend\u00e9e Globe not to feature any women because in many ways female sailing is riding the crest of a wave at the moment. The new CEO of the Volvo Ocean Race, Mark Turner, has introduced bold new rules incentivising teams to sail mixed, while as well as Team SCA in the Volvo Ocean Race we recently saw the first all-female team compete in the Extreme Sailing Series.\nAll this is happening at a time when UKSA, the Cowes-based charity, has moved to address a gender imbalance in the sport which sees fewer women taking up its courses than men and still fewer going on to work in the industry.\nThe Women into Sailing careers initiative was launched during Cowes Week this year and I was delighted to play a part. As a proud UKSA ambassador, and a graduate of one of the its professional training courses, I look forward to seeing the next generation of female sailors coming through.\nThis is a key moment. Women\u2019s sport is taking off and we do not want sailing to be left behind.\n\u00a0\nDee Caffari finished\u00a0sixth in the 2008-2009 Vendee Globe becoming in the process the first woman to sail solo, non-stop, around the world in both directions.\n", "title": "Lack of female skippers in this year's Vendee Globe a shame but women's sailing is thriving\u00a0"},

The last time the moon was this close to the Earth was in 1948.\nThe reason the distance varies is the moon's slightly elliptical orbit. On average, it is 238,900 miles from the Earth, but at the perigee it is about five per cent closer. At its furthest orbital point from the Earth, the apogee, it is five per cent more distant.\nPerigee and apogee distances vary from month to month due to several factors, such as whether the long axis of the lunar orbit is pointed towards the sun.\nMonday's event was billed as the biggest and best in a series of three supermoons. \u00a0The first was on October 16 and the third is due on December 14.\nAfter that, the event will not be matched until the moon makes a similar approach in 2034.\nYou can view other supermoon pictures in our gallery here.\nEver looked\u00a0up at the night sky to see a full\u00a0moon so close you could almost touch it? Well done, you've spotted a\u00a0supermoon.\u00a0\nThe impressive sight\u00a0happens\u00a0when a full moon\u00a0is closest to Earth. It orbits our planet in an oval shape so sometimes it comes closer to us than at other times.\u00a0To us Earth-lings,\u00a0the moon appears\u00a030 per cent brighter and 14 per cent bigger.\u00a0\nBy the way, supermoon is not an astrological term. It's scientific\u00a0name is perigee-syzygy, but supermoon is more catchy, and is used by the media to describe our celestial neighbour when it gets up close.\nAstrologer\u00a0Richard Nolle first\u00a0came up with the term and he defined it as \"\u2026 a new or full moon which occurs with the moon at or near (within 90 per cent\u00a0of) its closest approach to Earth in a given orbit\", according to earthsky.org.\nRobin Scagell, vice-president of the Society for Popular Astronomy, said: \"It will be above rooftops and trees and chimneys and always appears bigger that way because you're comparing it to foreground objects.\n\"I'm always pleased\u00a0for people to get their binoculars out and look up at the craters and the seas.\"\nAs well as being closer and brighter, the moon will look orange and red when it first rises.\u00a0As the moon gets higher in the sky, it returns to its normal white/yellow\u00a0colour.\u00a0\nThey're fairly frequent, although November's supermoon will be a once-in-a-generation sight.\u00a0There\u00a0are\u00a0six supermoons in 2016. We've already had four, and after next week\u00a0there's one on December 14. \u00a0\nEach\u00a0full moon of the year is given a name - although they vary according to the source. October's full moon is\u00a0referred to as the Hunter's moon because it\u00a0appears\u00a0very soon after sunset, and traditionally generated\u00a0more light for farmers working in the fields and hunters to spot wildlife.\u00a0\nIt might look close, but of course it's not that close.\u00a0November 14's\u00a0full moon will be the closest for 70 years.\u00a0The moon will come 221,524 miles from Earth -\u00a0almost touching distance in space terms.\u00a0\nThe closest full moon of the whole of the\u00a021st century will fall on December 6, 2052.\nPossibly, yes. Most people know that tides are governed by the gravitational pull of the moon and, to a lesser extent, the sun. Because the sun and moon go through different alignments, this affects the size of the tides.\nWhen the moon is closer to Earth, it\u00a0can lead to slightly higher tides, and greater variations between the tides.\nFull moon:\u00a0We all know what these are. They come around every month and light up the night at night.\nHarvest moon: The\u00a0full moon closest to the autumn equinox.\nBlack moon:\u00a0Most experts agree that this\u00a0refers to the second new moon in a calendar month.\u00a0The last black moon was at the start of October 2016 and the\u00a0next one\u00a0is expected in 2019.\nBlue moon:\u00a0A phenomenon that occurs when there is a second full moon in one calendar month.\u00a0Joe Rao\u00a0from space.com\u00a0explains: \"A second full moon in a single calendar month is sometimes called a blue moon. A black moon is supposedly the flip side of a blue moon; the second new moon in a single calendar month.\"\nThe infrequent nature of this lunar event led to the phrase \"once in a blue moon\" to signify a rare occurrence. It does not actually mean the moon will be blue.\nBlood moon: Also known as a\u00a0supermoon lunar eclipse. It's\u00a0when\u00a0the shadow of Earth casts a reddish glow on the moon, the result of a\u00a0rare combination of an eclipse with the closest full moon of the year. \u00a0There was one in September 2015, and before that in 1982\u00a0but the next one won't be until 2033.\u00a0\nStrawberry moon: A rare event when there's a full moon on the same day as the summer solstice. It happened in June 2016 for the first time since 1967 when\u00a017 hours of sunlight gave way to a bright moonlit sky.\nDespite the name, the moon does appear pink or red. The romantic label was coined by the Algonquin tribes of North America who believed June\u2019s full moon signalled the beginning of the strawberry picking season.\nAside from mythical meanings and unfounded alarmist proclamations, any full moon - never mind a supermoon as big as this \u00a0- has long been seen as having the ability to trigger emotional reactions and extreme behaviour.\nAnd while it may be easy to scoff, these theories have been given added credence in recent years by claims that there is a spike in admissions to hospitals when the moon is full, and by police forces reporting a rise in crime.\nJust last month, the Wall Street Journal reported that nearly all the staff in a hospital in Connecticut were convinced that a full moon ensured they had a busy night ahead of them.\nMeanwhile, a study published in the World Journal of Surgery in 2011 found that more than 40 per cent of medical staff believed lunar phases had an impact on human behaviour and, in 2007, Sussex Police announced that they would put extra officers on patrol on nights when the moon was full, following research that showed \u201ca correlation between violent incidents and full moons\u201d.\nOne theory is that the water in our bodies is affected by the movement of the moon in much the same way as its gravitational pull controls the tides. As the fluid in our body shifts, it tips the balance in our minds, which can trigger extreme emotions.\nThe \u201clunar effect\u201d, though, has been rubbished by a series of studies which have found no statistical correlation between lunar phases and events such as births, deaths, suicides, violence and psychiatric hospital admissions. However, says Dr Niall McCrae, a lecturer in mental health at King\u2019s College London and the author of 'The Moon and Madness\u2019, we should not dismiss the moon\u2019s effect so swiftly.\nAlthough he agrees the idea that our internal waters have some sort of tidal motion is \u201cunfounded\u201d, Dr McCrae points to studies that have shown the impact of moonlight on sleep as a feasible demonstration of the moon\u2019s effect on the brain. Swiss researchers found in 2013 that, on average, people slept for 20 minutes less when there was a full moon. It may not sound like much, but such differences might well be the reason for the centuries-old association of lunacy with lunar cycles.\nThe moon\u00a0is the Earth's only natural satellite. It's 4.6 billion years old and was formed between 30-50 million years after the solar system was formed.\u00a0\nThe moon is smaller than Earth.\u00a0It's about the same size as Pluto. In fact its\u00a0surface area is actually less than the surface\u00a0area of Asia - about 14.6 million square miles, according to space.com.\nA\u00a0new moon occurs every 29.5 days. The moon 'disappears' from the sky when it is between Earth and the sun\u00a0with it\u2019s illuminated side facing away from us.\nWhen the moon is opposite the sun we see a full moon as it's fully lit up by the sun. In between, we see a crescent moon as only some reflected sunlight is seen.\u00a0\nThe moon has earthquakes, caused by the gravitational pull of Earth. Experts believe the moon has a molten core, just like Earth.\u00a0\nOnly 12 people have ever walked on the moon and they were all American men, including (most famously) Neil Armstrong who was the first in 1969 on the Apollo II mission.\u00a0\nThe last time mankind sent someone to the moon was in 1972 when\u00a0Gene Cernan visited on the Apollo 17 mission.\nAlthough\u00a0Armstrong was the first man to walk on the moon,\u00a0Buzz Aldrin was the first man to urinate there. While millions watched the moon landing on live television, Aldrin was forced to go in a\u00a0tube fitted inside his space suit.\nWhen the\u00a0astronauts took off their helmets after their moonwalk, they noticed a strong smell, which Armstrong described as \u201cwet ashes in a fireplace\u201d and Aldrin as \u201cspent gunpowder\u201d. It was the smell of moon-dust brought in on their boots.\nThe mineral, armalcolite, discovered during the first moon landing and later found at various locations on Earth, was named after the three Apollo 11 astronauts, Neil ARMstrong, Buzz ALdrin and Michael COLlins.\nAn estimated 600 million people watched the Apollo 11 landing live on television, a world record until 750 million people watched the wedding of the Prince of Wales and Lady Diana Spencer in 1981.\nOne of President Nixon\u2019s speechwriters had prepared an address entitled: \u201cIn Event of Moon Disaster\u201d. It began: \u201cFate has ordained that the men who went to the moon to explore in peace will stay to rest in peace.\u201d If the launch from the Moon had failed, Houston was to close down communications and leave Armstrong and Aldrin to their death.\n\u00a0\n", "title": "What is a supermoon and when can I see the next one after clouds hampered view for many sky-gazers?"},

Stripping these out, adjusted profits rose\u00a05pc.\nPrimark\u2019s sales climbed 11pc, as it opened 22 stores in the year,\u00a0although like-for-like sales, which exclude store openings and closures, fell, in what Mr Weston called a market that was \u201cdown everywhere\u201d.\nFast-selling items last year included bomber jackets, while this autumn\u00a0denim jackets, coloured skinny jeans and striped dresses are de rigeur.\nThe plan is to open a further 25 Primark stores next year in the UK, Europe and three in the north east of the US.\n\u201cSome of the lessons we learned in the first year of trading in the US we can\u00a0implement next year,\u201d Mr Weston said. \u201cWe are doing really well, but we are much less known in the US.\u201d\nUS consumers, he said, had different tastes in terms of colour patterns and there were more small and large sizes to cater for.\n\u201cFlip flops sell fantastically well in the states, we learned that,\u201d he said. \u201cBoard shorts have to cover your knees and boxer shorts must be blue or black or white, rather than patterned.\u201d\nOn the sugar side, higher prices last year helped the business perform well and marked \"something of a turning point\", according to ABF chairman Charles\u00a0Sinclair.\n\u201cThe profit decline of recent years has been arrested as EU and word sugar prices turned upwards,\u201d he said. ABF\u2019s programme of cost-cutting also boosted margins, which fed through to increased profitability in sugar.\nNext year, the divison's\u00a0performance should be even sweeter as it feels the full impact of higher pricing and takes advantage of the end of EU\u00a0sugar quotas 2017, which will allow it to boost production.\nAnalysts at Liberum said: \"Despite short-term concerns,\u00a0ABF\u2019s long-term fundamentals appear robust and we retain our conviction that Primark and sugar will power mid-term profit growth.\"\u00a0\n", "title": "Primark owner ABF sees bright side from Brexit but warns sterling fall could hit margins"},
