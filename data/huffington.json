One of the...", "title": "Hands Down, THESE Are The Worst Shoes For Your Feet", "text": "Stilettos get a bad rap for throwing your body out of alignment, but don't think that just because your shoe is flat that it's better for you. One of the most walkable, flattest shoes around is just as bad as super-high heels: ballet flats. Unlike heels, which put all the pressure on the balls of your feet, flats add extra pressure to your heel, without any arch support, according to podiatrist Hillary Brenner, DPM. Additionally, \"a heel will lead to stress on the outside of the knee,\" says Miguel Cunha, DPM, at Gotham Footcare. \"A flat will lead to stress on the inside of the knee.\" \nStilettos, Higher Than 2 Inches Dr. Brenner: 9.75 Dr. Cunha: 9.5 \nNot all heels are created equal, obviously. There are plenty of factors to account for: stability, height, ankle support, etc. But if you're just looking at heel type and height, a stiletto with a heel higher than two inches is one of the worst shoes for your feet.  \nAny shoe higher than 4 inches got a 10 from Dr. Cunha, but even a 2.5-inch heel will severely disrupt your center of gravity. Extended wearing of these heels can cause pinched nerves and shortened tendons. Think about it: You're basically banging on the balls of your feet with every step. \nIf you do plan on wearing stilettos, both doctors recommend wearing them two to three hours max, and taking them off mid-day for a few exercises and stretches. \"You can draw the alphabet with your foot, or draw the number 8,\" Dr. Brenner recommends. \"Or you can take a tennis ball and roll your foot over that.\" Massage your arch to help your blood flow, which in turn helps prevent varicose veins or nerve irritation. Just remember: \"The higher the heel, the greater amount of pressure, and that will lead to issues in the bones,\" Dr. Cunha says.\nFlip-Flops Dr. Brenner: 10 Dr. Cunha: 9 \n\"Every time you take a step, your toes curl, and that leads to issues like hammertoes,\" Dr. Cunha says.\nBallet Flats Dr. Brenner: 9.75 Dr. Cunha: 8.5 \nFlats might feel like the comfiest shoes you've got, but \"[you] can be wearing comfy shoes, and they can be just as bad as heels,\" Dr. Brenner says. Without arch support or any sort of shock absorption for both the balls of your feet and the heels, people with flatter feet risk getting stress fractures and developing neuromas (enlargement of nerves between bones). For those with high arches? The shoes rank as a 7 for Dr. Cunha. But even then, the cut of a typical ballet flat could constrain your poor toes. \"When you're wearing pointy narrow shoes and not much support, the bones rub together,\" Dr. Brenner says. Not a fun \u2014 or comfortable \u2014 situation.\nBad Sneakers Dr. Brenner: 9 Dr. Cunha: 7 \nGranted, walking around in these all day is better than walking around in 5-inch heels; if you're just wearing them to brunch, Dr. Cunha rates them as a 4. But running, exercising, and doing anything more than walking in these? That's when the problems happen.\nMules Dr. Brenner: 8 Dr. Cunha: 6 \nMules are slightly deceiving: They look like a comfy, solid shoe, but the lack of ankle support makes them almost as bad as flip flops. \nThis goes for heeled mules, too. \"It's worse to have a heel that doesn't support the back of your feet,\" Dr. Cunha says. \" In addition to the extra weight on the front of your feet, you also have to curl your toes to make sure the shoe doesn't fall off to the side every time you plant your foot down.\" Heeled mules can leave you more susceptible to sprains, hammertoes, and bunions thanks to the constant flexing of your feet.\nGladiator Sandals Dr. Brenner: 7 Dr. Cunha: 6  \nThanks to the multiple ankle straps on gladiator sandals, these summer shoes are slightly better for your feet than mules and flip-flops \u2014 even when they're flat. Add a sturdy 1.5-inch heel, and you get a little more support with the style.  \nWhen buying heeled sandals, however, Dr. Brenner recommends taking a look at the arch support of the shoe. \"Yes, having a heel is great, but you still need that extra support below,\" Dr. Brenner says. \"If it has good arch support, then I would take it down to a 5 or a 6.\"\nStilettos, Lower Than 2 Inches Dr. Brenner: 7 Dr. Cunha: 5 \nAt less than 2 inches, the problem here isn't about the height: It's about the heel. \"In terms of stability, with a stiletto heel, you're more likely to develop an ankle sprain,\" Dr. Cunha says.  \nChunky Heel, Higher Than 2 Inches Dr. Brenner: 6 Dr. Cunha: 7.5 \nThese shoes get a slight pass thanks to their stable, squared-off heel. \"I'd say these are just two grades down from stilettos,\" Dr. Cunha says. \"You may not get an ankle sprain, but you're still putting all that pressure on the front of the foot.\"  \nJust remember: The higher a heel goes, the more pressure it puts on your feet \u2014 and the worse the shoes are. \"Anything above 4 inches, I would say, is an 8 or 9 here,\" Dr. Cunha says.\nChunky Heel, Lower Than 2 Inches Dr. Brenner: 4 Dr. Cunha: 4 \nAt two inches, chunky heels will still add extra stress to your knees and back. These will be better, however, than a 4-inch heel for everyday walking. \nTake the heel lower, however, to about 1 inch, and you may have found the perfect shoe. Booties with a 1-inch chunky heel received a rating of 2 from both doctors. Just like a 1-inch stiletto, the heel will provide extra arch support for those with flat feet. But unlike stilettos, the stable, square heel will help you avoid any rolled ankles \u2014 making those cobblestone streets just a bit safer.\nWedges  Dr. Brenner: 3 Dr. Cunha: 4 \nWedges might not be the most elegant of shoes, but the extra cushion of a good wedge makes these one of the best options for your feet \u2014 given that they're not too high. \"If I want to go for height, I almost always go for the wedge,\" Dr. Brenner says. \"With a wedge, you have a built-in arch support.\" Instead of wooden heels, however, Brenner recommends finding cork or rubber soles for extra shock absorption.\nGood Sneakers Dr. Brenner: 1 Dr. Cunha: 1 \nGood sneakers will provide ankle support and arch support. Both doctors recommended New Balance and Asics sneakers, with toe boxes that bend upward. \"You shouldn't be able to twist the shoe, and you want a good thick, wide arch with some cushion,\" Dr. Brenner says, noting that you want the shoe to support your feet fully from ankle to toe. \nOne good tip? \"Everyone should buy their shoes at the end of the day,\" Dr. Cunha says, \"because that's when your feet are the most swollen, after gravity brings all the fluid down.\"\nBy: Jessica Chou\n", "url": "http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/hands-down-these-are-the-worst-shoes-for-your-feet_us_581bad9ee4b01022624114ba", "tags": ["lifestyle"]},

With Hillary Clinton ", "title": "President Donald Trump's Acceptance Speech Was Surprisingly Coherent", "text": "The 2016 Presidential Election certainly didn't go down the way we were expecting at the Outspeak office. With Hillary Clinton refusing to make a public concession speech and Donald Trump becoming the 45th President of the United States, we're left reeling in disbelief. We figured he'd deliver a speech targeting those who didn't vote for him but instead he delivered a painfully rehearsed speech that felt manipulative and downright dangerous. At least he did attempt to appeal to those who did not vote for him with a promise of unifying the country.\nFirst Mike Pence took to the podium looking like a sun baked idiot squinting in the glare of the non-existent sun. He was positively overcome with excitement (we're kidding, he looked like a robot straight out of Westworld) about his new position of Vice President of the United States. He didn't really say much other than, \"Let's make America great again.\" \nThen, the orange incarnate, AKA the 45th President of the United States, shuffled his way to the podium like some sort of sloth-like sexual predator. At 11:50 PST Trump took the stage to thank the American people. He started out by calling the election \"complicated business.\" On that, we can agree.\nTrump said Clinton has congratulated \"us\" on a hard fought campaign over the phone. He spent some time vaguely talking about Hillary and her service to the country, repeating the same words several times. He then pledged to the American people, something that was important to him: to be a good President to even those who didn't support him. He spoke of unifying the American population, and wanting to help even those who did not vote for him. This was a small consolation in a night of sorrows.\nThe whole thing was rather hard to watch when you can see the stock marketing hitting record lows directly beside Trump's podium and the sad boy who lingers at the right side of the stage like his prisoner. He made more vague promises about rebuilding the country, taking care of veterans, and \"tremendous\" security. \nAs Trump went on, he made sure to let us know his plan is to make America as great as his companies. He said he wanted our nation to dream big once again, and to seek common ground. It all felt incredibly forced and phony, mostly because of how calm he remained throughout the speech. A calm Trump is a scary Trump. \nHe proceeded to thank his bizarre family, listing them each by name. To be fair, they must have a lot of patience to deal with a man like Trump on a regular basis. The thanks continued on for a while, and even the human skeleton with eyes (and known idiot), Rudy Giuliani, made the lengthy list. \nHe treated the tail end of the speech like a dude-bro getting his diploma by naming off all the \"great men\" he knows. Every name was greeted by cheers from the crowd and at a certain point it didn't seem like the bragging would end. It really did go on for a long time, believe me. It went on big league. \nTrump did admit that in order to be truly \"historic, you have to do a great job.\" And this is the absolute truth. We don't believe it, not in the slightest, but dear lords above and below, do we hope we are dead wrong. His resolution to begin working immediately is worrisome, and while the two years of campaigning are over, he made it clear that with four, possibly eight years, the nightmare has only just begun.\n", "url": "http://www.huffingtonpost.com/zac-thompson/president-donald-trumps-acceptance-speech_b_12877042.html?utm_hp_ref=outspeak", "tags": ["opinion"]},
{"abstract": "For Teen Vogue, by Deanna Pal.  \n  \n Acne might be the great equalizer, plaguing everyone regardless of their grades, gender, or their taste in music....", "title": "How To Treat Every Type Of Acne", "text": "You have: Big, red cysts \u2014 and a lot of them.\nWhat\u2019s going on: Cystic acne is no joke. Usually, it\u2019s the work of a combination of hormonal changes and genetics, and it\u2019s far and away the most stubborn type of acne. Because it\u2019s so tough to treat, it requires a few different treatment methods. In addition to topical acne-fighting ingredients like salicylic acid and benzoyl peroxide, you may want to consider oral antiobiotics to nix bacteria (which requires a trip to your doctor). A newer option worth trying? Probiotics. \u201cProbiotics have been shown to help cystic acne because they reduce inflammatory breakouts,\u201d says Kim Nichols, MD, a dermatologist in Greenwich, CT and consulting dermatologist for Avon.\nYou have: Small, red bumps that never come to a head.\nWhat\u2019s going on: Blame inflammation. A less-severe form of cystic acne, papular pustules are sensitive to the touch (from the inflammation) and also the work of hormones and genetics. On the bright side, this type of acne \u201crarely leads to permanent scarring like cystic acne can,\u201d says Nichols. She suggests using a mild exfoliant to keep the pores clean. One like BeautyRx Essential 8 percent Exfoliating Serum does the trick, but is still gentle enough to use every day.\nYou have: A pimple buried way beneath your skin.\nWhat\u2019s going on: Blind pimples are the worst, mostly because they can be incredibly painful. They\u2019re basically cystic acne that hasn\u2019t reached the surface of the skin. The good news, though, is that they often go away on their own \u2014 so you may feel the bump, but the chances of it actually emerging are pretty slim. (Don\u2019t even bother trying to squeeze it out. It\u2019ll only hurt like hell and could actually cause an infection beneath the skin.)\nYou have: A sprinkling of acne around your chin and jawline.\nWhat\u2019s going on: We\u2019re going to take a wild guess. Do those pimples usually appear around the same time every month? Breakouts around the lower half of the face are usually the work of fluctuating hormones. If you don\u2019t notice it lining up with your period, it could be a matter of hygiene. \u201cIt\u2019s rare, but the jawline and neck area are hard-to-reach areas and can be missed when you\u2019re cleansing,\u201d says Nichols. If you\u2019re double-cleanse on the daily, though, and know that it\u2019s not that, it\u2019s worth talking to your derm, since birth control can help level out those hormones. (Here\u2019s a guide to your options.)\nYou have: A regular whitehead.\nWhat\u2019s going on: Whiteheads (also known as comedones) are the classic zit case. They\u2019re essentially clogged pores caused by heavy oil production, which you\u2019re either born with or may be experiencing as a result of hormone fluctuations. The gunk that\u2019s clogged can trap bacteria into the pore, which leads to a mini-infection that brings about swelling, redness, and pain \u2014 AKA a pimple. \u201cA retinol cream, used a few nights per week, can minimize comedones,\u201d says Nichols, who recommends Avon Anew Clinical Line Eraser with Retinol Treatment.\nRelated: Dark Marks and Acne Scars: Your Complete Guide\nore from Teen Vogue:\nThe Top 10 Mistakes You\u2019re Probably Making When You Straighten Your Hair\n27 Must-See Celebrity Prom Throwback Photos\nMore Than Half of What You Eat Isn\u2019t Even Real Food, Study Finds\n", "url": "http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/how-to-treat-every-type-of-acne_us_58220617e4b044f827a79387", "tags": ["lifestyle"]},
{"abstract": "", "title": "What Does Your Style Say About You?", "text": "\nMost of us are not aware of what we're communicating most of the time...\nOften we get a hint of how we come across thru conversation with others. Or if we're fortunate enough to have a best friend who means well, she will let us know if something is amiss. And when we do find out through an outside source (usually to our disgust!) it seems far from the ideal vision we have for ourselves. \nAnd when it comes to dating men, it could be that you just can't seem to keep a very attractive man interested in you. Why do you think that is? It could be a number of things you're unaware of. The tone of voice which is seeking validation and coming across as needy perhaps, the fashion faux-pas you're making through your outfit combination, or some sort of insecurity that reveals itself through your mannerisms. \nA \"style coach\" can come in and pinpoint some of the factors that are contributing to what is causing you angst, and steer you in a direction that can fix them somewhat. But more often than not a 'style' coach would only be concerned with your outward appearance, your way of dressing, the clothes you wear and how you combine your outfits.  \nKnow that fashion is only one part of style. You need a coach who goes beyond just fixing your 'style'. A self-image consultant will go beyond that and help you with your self-expression to help you achieve elegance, which is deeper and comes from within. Because once unattractive flaws and mannerisms are identified, you will have the power to change them. \nAnd as you develop your own unique style, you can start infusing elegance so that the total combination of both transforms the way you dress, the way you talk, behave, move your body, or do anything for that matter. Simply put, your inner and outer expressions start to match. Very soon, your thoughts, emotions, interests and values start aligning with your outer appearance and everything on the outside becomes a mere reflection of what's on the inside. \nYou see, it's not enough to just follow fashion. Because being fashion-forward does not always contribute to elegance. And elegance is what you want. Do you have to be an unstoppable force of charisma who looks impeccable all the time? Of course not! Your style could be more about comfort than fashion, but you have adopted that innate capability now to be charismatic. You are now the type of woman that everyone loves and is drawn towards. You become instantly and effortlessly attractive. \nSuddenly you're building your own unique self-brand. You start exuding influence in just about any setting without even intending to do so. People start trusting you more and whatever words you say to them will carry more credibility because you are the living epitome of elegance. Your words, actions, mannerisms and confidence become apparent. \nElegance as we know it is very rare indeed in the world we live in today. It was rare before, and even more rare now. \nUltimately the message we get across to others has very little to do with the words we use in any conversation. Our body language; the tone, pitch and volume we use in our voice, the expression on our face when we communicate, these are all part of the non-verbal communication that reveals our true nature. We can come across as insensitive and domineering, or shy and insecure. However, once we become more aware of all these innuendos and deliberately strive to achieve that elegance that is the hallmark of classiness, a shift happens. \nYour lifestyle and your surroundings start to match your persona. Your values shift to encompass all that you represent and embody. Now no matter what you say, do or express, all is in harmony. Now there is no doubt in anyone's mind who you are and what you are about. \nThis, my friends, is what you want. \n", "url": "http://www.huffingtonpost.com/rani-st-pucchi/what-does-your-style-say-_b_12802718.html", "tags": ["lifestyle"]},

But hold on a second, whether you\u2019re doing it for #movember, for better Tinder pics, or to keep your face warm this winter, you will definitely run into some snags as your new beard grows in. So don\u2019t be surprised if your face reacts badly to the change and you end up with some gnarly beard-related acne. This follicular side effect is gross, can be painful, and is unfortunately very common. But the good news is, there\u2019s a perfectly easy solution to your pimple problem. We asked Evan Rieder MD, FAAD, a general and cosmetic dermatologist and an Assistant Professor of Dermatology at NYU Medical Center, why guys break out when they grow a beard and how to avoid it in the future. Here\u2019s what he said:\n\u201cWe often see an increase in acne and ingrown hairs (which may look like acne bumps) when men grow a beard or move from a clean shave to an unshaven look. The reasons for this are multifactorial, but most relate to hygiene. Men tend to negate beard grooming, and beard hair can collect a lot of debris and bacteria that can predispose to the development of acne.\u201d\nTranslation: \nDuring the day, your facial hair collects dust, dirt, and bacteria that can cause pimples. If you don\u2019t wash your beard that pimple causing bacteria thrives.\nEverything You Need To Take Care Of Your Beard\n\u201cTo help prevent and treat facial hair related pimples, men should wash their beard twice daily with a facial cleanser, switch pillowcases every few days, and pay better attention to grooming. Particularly in people with curly hair, short beard hair can grow back into the skin and cause a foreign-body response, which can lead to the development of red and painful bumps that look like acne. The body actually reacts to its own hair as something foreign, and mounts an immune response to it. We see less of these foreign-body responses once the beard is longer, however acne can still be a problem if the hygiene is poor. If these methods don\u2019t work, then a dermatologist can prescribe antibiotic treatments that may help keep acne at bay. If these problems persist despite medical therapy, laser therapy is a good way to remove problematic areas of hair that repeatedly cause bumps.\u201d\nPlan of Attack:\nMore from GQ:\nWhy Your Beard Is Red, Even If Your Hair Isn\u2019t\nThe Best Celebrity Haircuts of 2016\nThe Best Haircuts for Men\nThe Best Facial Hair for Your Face Shape\n7 Grooming Moves to Steal From Your Favorite Rapper\n", "url": "http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/how-to-get-rid-of-beard-related-pimples_us_5820e1e4e4b044f827a7917e", "tags": ["lifestyle"]},

Presidential election night has decidedly been made a huge event where people can see how their right to vote impacts their nation. \nWe've already seen that Trump voters are less educated and have almost no political voice. It's important to highlight because these people are almost always found in places with high levels of prejudice. By supporting Trump, they undercut the foundations of democracy. \nFilmmakers, Akram Shibly and Brenden Gregory have created a new film to prove that Trump and his supporters are wrong.

{"abstract": "\"I'm freaking out.\"", "title": "Kendall Jenner\u2019s Sleep Paralysis Is Actually Pretty Common", "text": "On Sunday, Kendall Jenner opened up about struggling with a sleep problem that is thought to affect nearly eight percent of the general population: sleep paralysis.\n\u201cI wake up in the middle of the night and I can\u2019t move,\u201d Jenner said in the latest episode of Keeping Up With the Kardashians. \u201cI\u2019m freaking out.\u201d\nIndeed, sleep paralysis is a phenomenon where you are awake and conscious, but your body is paralyzed (except for your eyes) and between 80 and 90 percent of the time you experience nightmares or disturbing hallucinations.\u00a0\n\u201cThey [can be] scary experiences,\u201d\u00a0Brian A.\u00a0Sharpless, associate professor at the American School of Professional Psychology at Argosy University and author of Sleep Paralysis,\u00a0told The Huffington Post.\nEpisodes happen during your lightest stage of sleep \u2015 rapid eye movement sleep (REM), during which you dream \u2015 and can last anywhere from a few seconds to a few (terrifying!) minutes.\nSharpless is not Jenner\u2019s doctor, but he noted that several struggles Jenner discussed in the show, such as anxiety and jet lag, can increase the risk of experiencing the scary episodes.\n\u201cEveryone says I\u2019m fine, but I don\u2019t feel fine,\u201d Jenner told her mother Kris Jenner on the show.\nThe episodes can be terrifying, Sharpless said. But for most people, sleep paralysis episodes are a one-time or occasional experience \u2015 and they\u2019re not necessarily a problem or dangerous.\u00a0\nHere are four other important facts about sleep paralysis:\nResearch has suggested sleep paralysis is way more common in people with mental health issues and young adults, affecting more than 28 percent of students, nearly 32 percent of psychiatric patients and nearly 35 percent of people with panic disorder.\nEstimates suggest that somewhere between 15 and 45 percent of people with sleep paralysis experience such episodes repeatedly, and not as a side effect of another sleep disorder or condition \u2015 which is known as recurrent isolated sleep paralysis. People with the recurrent condition also tend to have trouble with sleep because of the episodes, such as trouble falling asleep or avoiding sleep out of fear.\n\u201cYou don\u2019t have the disorder if it just happens once,\u201d Sharpless said. \u201cAnd it has to actually be affecting your behavior [to be recurrent isolated sleep paralysis].\u201d\u00a0\nPracticing good sleep behavior like skipping alcohol and caffeine before heading to bed and waking up and going to bed at the same time everyday can help anyone avoid sleep paralysis.\nAnother tip: sleep on your side, Sharpless said. Sleeping on your back or stomach make sleep paralysis way more likely, he explained.\nAnd for people with the recurrent condition, a sleep medicine specialist or psychologist may be able to prescribe medications that help suppress REM sleep (and therefore help people avoid sleep paralysis).\u00a0\nTaking the simple steps of getting on a regular sleep schedule, skipping alcohol and caffeine before bed and sleeping on her side, all might help Jenner\u2019s episodes go away, Sharpless said.\nAnd if those fixes don\u2019t help, he said Jenner (or anyone experiencing similar symptoms) should consider seeing a sleep medicine specialist or psychologist who could help determine if the episodes are something more serious.\u00a0\n", "url": "http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/kendall-jenner-sleep-paralysis_us_580a2833e4b0cdea3d86e413", "tags": ["science"]},

Astronomers call that point perigee, and so \u201cperigee moon\u201d is another term for supermoon.\u00a0(The point at which the moon is most distant from Earth in its orbit is known as apogee.)\nA supermoon can appear up to 14 percent bigger and 30 percent brighter than an apogee full moon, according to NASA.

{"abstract": "The state has some of the strictest gun laws in the country. Voters just said they\u2019re not enough.", "title": "California Just Got Even Tougher On Guns", "text": "Californians voted Tuesday to pass Proposition 63,\u00a0a sweeping gun control measure that will bolster the state\u2019s already substantial restrictions on firearms and ammunition.\u00a0\nThe ballot initiative, spearheaded by California Lt. Gov. Gavin Newsom (D), will implement a slew of new gun regulations intended to help prevent mass shootings. The measure bans possession of large-capacity magazines, mandates background checks and permits for ammunition purchases, requires individuals and businesses to report lost or stolen firearms, and makes all firearm thefts felonies regardless of the value of the weapon. The measure will also set up a process for courts to remove guns from people convicted of certain crimes.\u00a0\nNewsom, who is running for governor in 2018, unveiled the ballot measure during a press conference in San Francisco last October. He argued the proposed regulations could help curb mass shootings by making it more difficult for people to purchase guns and ammunition.\n\u201cWe have the ability to do something about [mass shootings],\u201d he said. \u201cWe have the capacity to turn things around.\u201d\u00a0\nSome of the components of Proposition 63 were already put into place when California Gov. Jerry Brown (D) signed six gun bills into law this summer. However, Newsom argued\u00a0his proposed measure goes further than the laws signed by Brown and will close loopholes in existing state laws. For example, one law signed by Brown requires showing an ID and undergoing an instant background check in order to buy ammunition, while Newsom\u2019s proposal requires gun owners to obtain a four-year permit from California\u2019s Department of Justice before purchasing bullets.\u00a0\nThe initiative received support from many of the state\u2019s most prominent politicians, including Sens. Barbara Boxer and Dianne Feinstein, state Senate President Pro Tem Kevin de Le\u00f3n, San Francisco Mayor Ed Lee, California Secretary of State Alex Padilla and many other Democratic officials.\u00a0\nProposition 63 also faced fierce opposition from gun rights groups, which argued the rules would just make it harder for law-abiding people to buy guns while doing nothing to keep firearms out of the hands of criminals. A website called StopNewsom.com, funded by the Firearms Policy Coalition, particularly took issue with the measure\u2019s restrictions on ammunition purchases, calling the proposed rules \u201cburdensome\u201d and a \u201cmassive infringement on your Constitutional rights.\u201d\u00a0\nHowever, the nation\u2019s most prominent gun lobby \u2015 the National Rifle Association \u2015 largely stayed out of the fray, spending just $95,000 to try to defeat the measure. (In contrast, the NRA has put up almost\u00a0$4 million to fight a background check measure in Nevada.) That disparity could be credited to California\u2019s demographics \u2015 the state is largely Democratic, and polls indicated the measure was likely to pass.\u00a0The laws signed by Brown earlier this year also may have discouraged the NRA from spending much on the campaign, as some of the components most objectionable to gun rights activists were already set to go into effect.\nDespite the group\u2019s relative absence from the campaign, Newsom has touted passing the ballot initiative as a victory over the NRA and other arms of the gun lobby. Earlier this month, Newsom challenged NRA executive Wayne LaPierre to a public debate on the measure:\u00a0\nProposition 63\u2019s components are set to go into effect next year.\n", "url": "http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/california-gun-law_us_5818e50ae4b00f11fc5c22aa", "tags": ["politics"]},

{"abstract": "Rhythm holds the key to good sex, a study suggests.", "title": "Sexual Pleasure Literally Puts You Into A Trance", "text": "Many people feel that they \u201close control\u201d in the climax of a sexual encounter, and research shows this is a very apt description of what\u2019s going on in the brain.\nIn a paper in the journal Socioaffective Neuroscience & Psychology\u00a0last month, Northwestern University neuroscientist Adam Safron proposes that the rhythmic nature of sexual activity gives rise to a trance state involving total sensory absorption and a loss of self-awareness.\nHe compares the process to \u201cpushing someone on a swing,\u201d because the rhythmic nature of sexual stimulation can cause neurons in the brain to oscillate at the same frequency. This is known as \u201cneural entrainment.\u201d\u00a0If the stimulation is intense and sustained enough, then synchronized activity can spread throughout the brain.\nSuch synchronization can create a state of focused attention that silences normal self-awareness, allowing us to \u201close ourselves\u201d in the moment. We access a state of sensory absorption during a sexual trance, which can build up an intensity of experience that helps trigger climax.\u00a0\nFrom a neuroscientific perspective, sex may be an altered state of consciousness and perhaps even a form of meditative practice, according to Safron, who studies the neurological basis of sexual preference.\n\u201cThis way of viewing sexual experience is very different from, but consistent with, conceptualizing sex solely in terms of desire, pleasure, and arousal,\u201d he told The Huffington Post on Wednesday. \u201cI suspect that viewing sexuality as a kind of altered state of consciousness could help people to see sex as something extraordinary, potentially helping them to have a greater appreciation for their partners, and possibly even helping to prevent sex from losing its fascination.\u201d\nThis fits with what we know about orgasms. They usually result from rhythmic stimulation of body parts\u00a0that are high in sensory receptors. And\u00a0some studies of sexual climax have shown that brain regions involved in higher-order cognition and executive function deactivate, suggesting a temporary \u201closs of control.\u201d\u00a0\nIn this way,\u00a0sexual activity can be compared to music and dance \u2015 all involve the ability to lose oneself in a rhythm and to potentially access an altered state of consciousness. In several early cultures, anthropologists\u00a0have found evidence of rhythmic drumming,\u00a0singing, chanting and dancing being used to access trance states.\u00a0\nThe takeaway? Paying more attention to rhythm could be a powerful way to improve your sex life.\u00a0\n\u201cThe ability to maintain and adjust rhythms precisely, and with variety, helps to make someone both a good dancer and a good lover,\u201d Safron said.\u00a0\u201cFocusing on the rhythmic aspects of sexuality could both help people to enjoy sex more and to be more of the kinds of lovers that they want to be.\u201d\n", "url": "http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/sexual-pleasure-trance_us_581a0950e4b01f610e395c14", "tags": ["science"]},

While on the surface it would seem that since this is beyond the 12-month warranty period, I believe that we had a valid case for an exception because the laptop did not function correctly from day one, required three onsite visits by technicians who took the laptop apart and replaced numerous parts, as well as several very long technical troubleshooting sessions over the phone in which it was discovered that the laptop had the wrong or outdated software.\nThe laptop was finally repaired to the point of being usable three months after the purchase date, and I believe that it is only fair that the warranty should have started at that point. It is also my contention that the several service calls which took the laptop apart could have very well caused harm to the motherboard. I asked Dell to consider these facts and repair the laptop at their expense. They have refused.\nI am pushing this issue because I think that it is only right for a company to stand behind their product. When a product is sold that is totally defective, then that product should have been replaced, and the warranty restarted. Dell seems to think that they do not have to stand behind their product.\nHaving worked for Fortune 500 companies, I'm well aware that there is an exception process for warranties that would seem to apply when a product has shown itself to be grossly problematic, as ours was. When this was brought to a supervisor's attention, he agreed that Dell had an exception process, but could not articulate why our computer would not apply. He simply kept repeating that our computer was not under warranty, and there was nothing he could do.\nAnswer: Your Dell warranty lasted a year, no more, no less. (Technically, it's one year \"beginning on the date of invoice,\" according to the manufacturer.) The company can bend its own rules whenever it wants to, but it doesn't have to.\nWell, shoot, if I'd read this before buying a Dell, I would have had second thoughts about the warranty. Certainly, even if Dell would extend the warranty, who's to say it would mean it would replace your motherboard?\nYou followed all the steps to a resolution, including starting a paper trail and then appealing your case to four levels of Dell's executive customer service contacts. But nothing seemed to work.\nI contacted Dell on your behalf and was encouraged when I heard back from the company right away. A representative apologized for your problems and promised to send your repair request to Dell's \"escalations team\" for a resolution.\nBut that resolution never came. A Dell employee contacted you and said that despite all the problems with your Inspiron, Dell was not going to cover the cost of fixing it. I'm hesitant to write about a case that wasn't resolved, but you encouraged me to cover your problem in a column as a warning to others: When Dell says 12 months, that's exactly what it means.\n", "url": "http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/this-dell-laptop-never-worked-how-about-a-refund_us_581f553ce4b0334571e09d7c", "tags": ["tech"]},

But let\u2019s put the presidential campaign aside for a second and talk about weed.\u00a0\nMarijuana was on the ballot in nine states on Tuesday. Voters in eight of those states went to the polls and approved measures to roll back longstanding restrictions on the drug,\u00a0delivering a historic victory for marijuana police reformers.\nBy the end of the night, four states approved recreational marijuana, with California, Nevada, Massachusetts and Maine all rejecting prohibition and opting to tax and regulate the drug instead. The efforts doubled the number of states with legal weed, bringing the total to eight, which are home to nearly a quarter of the nation\u2019s population. Florida, Arkansas, North Dakota and Montana also voted on marijuana for medical use, bringing the total to 29 states and Washington, D.C. \nOnly Arizona, which was considering recreational marijuana legalization, voted down their measure on Tuesday.\nThe results, as well as the scale of the successes \u2015 which saw measures like Florida\u2019s passed by huge double-digit margins \u2015 will give a shot in the arm to the campaign for legalization and reform, said marijuana policy experts.\n\u201cThis is the most momentous Election Day in history for the movement to end marijuana prohibition,\u201d said Rob Kampia, executive director of Marijuana Policy Project. \u201cThese votes send a clear message to federal officials that it\u2019s time to stop arresting and incarcerating marijuana users. Congress must take action to ease the tension between state and federal marijuana laws.\u201d\nThe trend of state-level legalization reflects a broader cultural shift toward acceptance of marijuana, the most commonly used illicit substance in the United States. National support for the legalization of marijuana has risen dramatically in recent years, reaching historic highs in multiple polls just last month. States like Colorado have established regulated marijuana marketplaces, and successes there have debunked some lawmakers and law enforcers\u2019 predictions that such polices would result in disaster.\nStill, the federal government continues to ban cannabis, classifying it in Schedule I as one of the \u201cmost dangerous\u201d drugs, alongside heroin and LSD. States have been able to forge ahead on legalization despite the federal ban, helped in part by federal guidance that urged prosecutors to refrain from targeting marijuana operations that are legal under state law.\nPresident\u00a0Barack Obama\u00a0has suggested the government may soon need to reassess its position. In an interview with \u201cReal Time\u201d host Bill Maher\u00a0on his show that aired last week, Obama said successes in the legalization movement should lead to \u201ca more serious conversation about how we are treating marijuana and our drug laws generally.\u201d\n\u201cIf, in fact, [marijuana legalization] passed in all these states [on Tuesday], you now have about a fifth of the country that\u2019s operating under one set of laws, and four-fifths in another,\u201d Obama said. \u201cThe Justice Department, DEA, FBI \u2015 for them to try to straddle and figure out how they\u2019re supposed to enforce laws in some places and not in others \u2014 they\u2019re gonna guard against transporting these drugs across state lines, but you\u2019ve got the entire Pacific corridor where this is legal \u2014 that is not gonna be tenable.\u201d\nBut soon, federal marijuana policy will be in President-elect\u00a0Donald\u00a0Trump\u2019s court. Trump has said he would respect states\u2019 rights on the issue, but his potential incoming administration has some marijuana reformers worried.\nEthan Nadelmann, executive director of the Drug Policy Alliance, said he was deeply concerned because Trump\u2019s most likely appointees to senior law enforcement positions \u2015 former New York City Mayor\u00a0Rudy Giuliani and New Jersey Gov.\u00a0Chris Christie\u00a0\u2015 and Vice President-elect Mike Pence \u201care no friends of marijuana reform.\u201d\n\u201cThe progress we\u2019ve made, and the values that underlie our struggle \u2015 freedom, compassion, reason and justice \u2015 will be very much at risk when Donald Trump enters the White House,\u201d he said.\nGiuliani has called legalizing marijuana in any form a \u201cmistake.\u201d\u00a0And Christie said if he were president, he would \u201ccrack down\u201d on legalization and \u201cenforce the federal laws.\u201d Both men have been rumored to be in line for cabinet positions in the Trump Administration, perhaps attorney general.\nTom Angell, chairman of drug policy reform group Marijuana Majority, said he expects Trump to hold true to his pledge not to interfere with existing state laws.\n\u201cTrump has clearly and repeatedly pledged to respect state marijuana laws, and we fully expect him to follow through on those promises, not only because it is the right thing to do but also because these reforms are broadly supported by a growing majority of voters,\u201d Angell said. \u201cReversing course and going against the tide of history would present huge political problems that the new administration does not need.\u201d\n", "url": "http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/election-day-marijuana-votes_us_5822e05ae4b0aac6248854e6", "tags": ["politics"]},

But in October 2015, The Wall Street Journal exposed major problems with the company\u2019s marquee product, which claimed to be able to run 240 different tests on a single drop of blood.\nTheranos vehemently denied the report, but new revelations kept coming.

(The letter was also published on Slack\u2019s site.)\nIn the letter, Slack welcomes Microsoft to \u201cthe revolution.\u201d It\u2019s\u00a0\u201cvalidating\u201d and \u201ca little scary\u201d to have the competition, the letter acknowledges, while also making it clear that Slack was totally here first. \u00a0\n\u201cAll this is harder than it looks,\u201d the letter states. \u201cWe know that playing nice with others isn\u2019t exactly your MO, but if you can\u2019t offer people an open platform that brings everything together into one place and makes their lives dramatically simpler, it\u2019s just not going to work.\u201d\u00a0\nSlack\u2019s letter has some precedent. In 1981, Apple took out a full-page ad in The Wall Street Journal to congratulate IBM for developing a personal computer, Digg noted. \nA promotional\u00a0video introducing Microsoft Teams describes it as \u201ca chat-based workspace that gives people one place to connect and create in inherently human ways.\u201d\u00a0The app will include video chat and threaded comments, according to TechCrunch. \nSlack has 4 million daily active users, according to Fortune, and plenty of competitors \u2015 last month, Facebook announced its chat app, Facebook Workplace, which is already in use at 1,000 companies, Facebook said.\nTo be fair, Microsoft doesn\u2019t have much of a reputation for leading the way when it comes to advancements in tech.

Which colleagues are the naysayers?\u00a0You know -- the\u00a0people\u00a0who you think of as \"...", "title": "The Culture Behind Leading-Edge Technology Companies", "text": "Take a moment and think about your team. Which colleagues are the naysayers?\u00a0You know -- the\u00a0people\u00a0who you think of as \"The Mallet\" for their ability to smash promising ideas like a game of Whac-A-Mole.\nOf course, technology leaders should know how and when to say \"no\" to ideas that do not line up with the company's product plan. But if it feels like you are working in an arcade hall or your mental cheeks are a bit red from getting smacked around, something is terribly wrong.\nWhen \"no\" becomes the knee-jerk response to new ideas, it builds\u00a0a culture of fear that stifles innovation. And that is a real problem at companies large and small.\nLeading-edge companies recognize the danger in avoiding new things out of fear of the unfamiliar.\u00a0They embrace tireless iteration and changing course when better solutions arise. And they avoid that knee-jerk \"no.\"\nConsider\u00a0Toyota, which started as a loom-making company in the 1920s. Today they sell more cars globally than anyone else. Another good example is\u00a0General Electric. After significantly evolving over the last 124 years, GE is now\u00a0reinventing itself\u00a0as a digital powerhouse.\u00a0\nCompanies that act on new ideas lead the way to change -- outpacing the naysayers in the process. The ones left behind slowly sink under the weight of a thousand \"nos.\"\nIf you suspect your company is averse to new ideas, here are a few corrective\u00a0measures:\nShare the vision\nIs strategy shared with everyone -- or is it only for a privileged few? Forward-thinking leaders are transparent. It's not enough to\u00a0make goals visible\u00a0to the whole team. Each person needs to understand their unique value to the company and role in helping the company fulfill those goals. As a result, they're more likely to\u00a0ideate in ways that line up with the strategic vision. \u00a0\nSupport openness\nGood ideas can come from anywhere. Encourage a culture of openness and provide a forum for anyone to contribute new ideas or improve upon existing ones. At Aha! we built an\u00a0ideas portal\u00a0right into our roadmapping software so that anyone -- from customers to employees -- can submit enhancements and new solutions, as well as vote on the ones they'd most like to see implemented.\u00a0\nStay invested\nManagers with a \"no\" mindset are quick to poke holes without acknowledging merit. But hastily rejecting a fledgling idea helps no one -- least of all the\u00a0person trying to contribute\u00a0to the success of the organization. When you show that you are invested, your team will not deflate when an idea is not adopted. Before rejecting an idea,\u00a0ask thoughtful questions to make sure you fully understand what is being suggested and push the creator to fully vet the possibilities.\u00a0\nShow kindness\nYou can be a decisive leader and say \"no\" to a weak idea without crushing someone's spirit. Be honest and specific to help the person understand why their idea may be premature -- which may help lead to a better one. If there were elements of the idea that you did like, say so! If not, explain the value framework that you are using to dismiss it. Encourage them to keep on contributing.\u00a0\nNot every idea will make the cut. But innovative companies promote a culture where ideas stand a chance to thrive.\u00a0\nSmart leaders do not allow fear to rule the day. They are not afraid to imagine the possibilities and ask \"what if.\" They are open-minded about the future\u00a0and support an ongoing stream of ideas that will help the company compete and innovate.\nThese are the companies and the people\u00a0that I love to work with, and you likely do too. We should all put the mallet down before we smack what actually matters.\u00a0\nHow does your company avoid the culture of \"no\"?\n", "url": "http://www.huffingtonpost.com/brian-de-haaff/the-culture-behind-leadin_b_12776284.html", "tags": ["tech"]},

The real estate industry is adopting this evolving technology to hel...", "title": "Virtual Reality: How Tech Is Changing The Way You Buy And Sell A Home", "text": "Virtual reality is no longer associated with just gaming. The real estate industry is adopting this evolving technology to help you buy and sell your home in ways never before possible.\nSay you're moving to another state, or you're interested in buying new construction and your home hasn't been built. You can take a virtual tour of your future home without leaving the comfort of the one you live in now.\nOr maybe it's time to sell, and you want a leg up in a competitive market. Now you can entice potential buyers with a 3-D rendering of your home before they step inside for a showing.\nHow does it work?\n\"Real estate is probably the only asset class that is experiential and trades in emotion,\" says Steven Giles, a broker with Douglas Elliman Real Estate in New York. \"I think virtual reality technology has greatly enhanced that experience.\" Giles says that in competitive markets, it's especially helpful for sellers to have access to the latest technology.\nSan Francisco-based Matterport is one of several media technology companies offering brokers, real estate agents and service providers 3-D cameras to capture a home's interior. Matterport stitches the images together to provide a walkthrough that uploads onto a cloud service. You can view the property as a 3-D model using your smartphone, tablet, computer or virtual reality headset.\nMatterport is now adding elements of augmented reality -- the superimposing of computer elements onto real settings -- to its walkthroughs, says CEO Bill Brown. \"In addition to being able to walk through the space, people can mark in objects within the space, and they can annotate those objects,\" he says. These notes can highlight features such as granite countertops or energy-efficient appliances.\nVirtual reality tours are a good way to reduce the number of physical home walkthroughs you have to make because they help you narrow down your search, Brown says. He's seen buyers arrive at the first open house ready to make an offer because they've already done a virtual walkthrough. \"It just builds momentum around the transaction much more quickly.\"\nReal estate media company Circle Visions, also based in San Francisco, is working on another use of the technology: creating properties that don't yet exist. People who are building their own home or remodeling their current one can use virtual reality headsets to get a sense of what the property will look like once it's completed.\n\"When you look at a blueprint, you don't really get a sense of how it feels to be in that property, whereas with virtual reality, you're right in it,\" says Bob Yuan, president of Circle Visions. \"You can open doors, you can turn on the lights; you get a feel for the scale or the sense of that room.\"\nHow much does it cost?\nAs a seller, you won't pay a real estate company specifically for your property to be viewed through virtual reality, but the service cost might be included in your agent's fees. If your real estate agent can create a 3-D model of your home, ask her how much she charges for this service. Homebuyers don't have to pay anything to view homes in virtual reality.\n\nWhat are the drawbacks?\nMoving from room to room in a virtual space might make some homebuyers feel a bit wobbly. Because VR is in its early stages, people are still figuring out the right techniques, Brown says. \"I liken it to website design way back when the internet was new,\" he says. \"You would see all kinds of weird things in terms of how people set up their websites. Eventually people kind of settled on a set of norms for navigation and layout.\"\nYou may also have some trouble finding a real estate agent or broker who uses the technology, especially if you don't live in a large metropolitan area. Most brokerage and real estate firms still use 2-D photography and video walkthroughs to market properties. And the companies that do use virtual reality are, for the most part, marketing higher-end properties.\nIf your broker or real estate agent doesn't use virtual reality, ask her whether she'd be willing to look into it, as it could benefit her business as well.\nWhere is the technology headed?\nBrown predicts that virtual reality will someday replace 2-D photography. \"To me, there's no reason to have a gallery of disjointed pictures without having that spatial tie, when just as easily you can create an immersive environment of that space,\" he says.\nGiles thinks virtual reality will become more common in the coming years and that it could replace traditional sales offices or model homes or apartments.\n", "url": "http://www.huffingtonpost.com/nerdwallet/virtual-reality-how-tech_b_12870624.html", "tags": ["business"]},
{"abstract": "", "title": "The Startling Decline of Harley Davidson", "text": "\nHarley Davidson - a well-known brand to any motorcycle enthusiast - is going through a rough patch. Many changes have taken place in the past few years, and not all of them were for the best.\nFacing stiff competition from European and Japanese manufacturers and the continual rise of Polaris and its motorcycle division, Harley is finding difficulty in reaching its revised target of 264,000-269,000 motorcycle shipments this year.\nAmerica's largest motorcycle manufacturer is losing shares to foreign competitors such as Yamaha, Kawasaki, and Honda. Not only are their shares dropping, but the company has also faced legal issues.\nAround October 2016, Harley Davidson had to pay a $12 million penalty to the federal government due to an accusation of selling around 340,000 motorcycles that polluted the air at a rate higher than the federal Clean Air Act allows. Many Americans prefer to buy a car as opposed to a motorcycle. \nWhat does it signal?\nThe trends are shifting, and people are more conscious regarding health, comfort and their overall status.\nIn Q3 2016, the net profit for Harley Davidson reduced by 19%, or $114.1 million, compared to $140.3 million at a similar time last year, according to the company. \nThe consolidated revenue amounted to $1.27 billion compared to last year's $1.32 billion during the same period. \nIn 2014, US market share rose to 55.5%, and by 2015, there was a significant drop to 51.9%. Since then, the shares have increased by only 1%. \n\"The deliveries of Harley Davison bikes to Europe have significantly declined over the last few years. The Milwaukee motorcycle producer is planning to reorganize its production in Q4. The plan is to reduce the number of staff, which will cost the company an estimated $20-25 million,\" says, David Collins, A1AutoTransport Inc. \nDucati has a high potential of overtaking Harley Davidson if the statistics continue as they're going.\nDucati's sales increased by 10% in 2015 in the United States, while Harley Davidson's sales decreased by 1.7%. Besides Ducati's growth, other companies are also giving tough competition to this heavyweight motorcycle.\nHonda has always been famous for its cars, and few people knew of the fact that the company manufacturers motorcycles as well.\nHowever, in 2015, motorcycles brought so much profit for Honda that it became its third largest business segment. You might wonder if the first one is cars and the third one is motorcycles, then what's the second one? \nThe answer is: \nFinancial services. This sector brings Honda just as much profit as motorcycles do. \nLooking at the total motorcycle market figures from January to March 2016, there were 24,994 sales made. Honda was a leading manufacturer by volume with 5,512 units sold.\nYamaha was in the second spot with 4,995 units. In the last places, with an average of 2400 units sold, were Kawasaki, Suzuki, and Harley Davidson, as stated in the order.\nHowever, this picture changes if you look at road motorcycles only. Even though Honda is still the leading manufacturer, Harley-Davidson took second place in the sales department in 2016.\nJust like cars, motorbikes have individual classes from sports to luxury and comfort. So, it is unfair to compare different categories of motorcycles only by the number of sales made.\nHarley Davidson is a brand known for its unique style and elegance. \nNowadays, younger generations are looking for speed, sporty style, and comfort in the vehicles they drive. They lead active lives and drive fast cars, so it only makes sense that they'd want fast motorcycles too.\nThis is where Harley-Davidson, unfortunately, can't compete. The top leaders of the fastest bikes are Suzuki with a top speed of 248mph, Kawasaki with 220mph and Ducati with 169mph.\nRay of Hope\nMatt Levatich, the CEO of motorcycle maker Harley-Davidson, wants U.S. suppliers to be globally competitive by matching the costs of overseas rivals. \nHe also considers young adults as the most important segment. The investments on new engines, favoring a particular model, and other updates won't be decided by the core market of just older white men. \nThe bikes that appeal to younger adults, women, and minorities will be given more priority. Just like with anything in life, the new replaces the old, and if you don't catch up with what's in demand, your brand will get replaced as well.\nHarley Davidson still has many more years of success in the market, but if they continue in the way they are going now, the end will eventually come.\n", "url": "http://www.huffingtonpost.com/yatin-khulbe/the-startling-decline-of-_b_12796210.html", "tags": ["business"]},

McDonald's said it has ended its \"Create Your Taste\" customization platform in the U.S. in favor of the simpler \"Signature Crafted Recipes\" platform that it began testing in San Diego in February. The story was first reported by Business Insider.\nThe \"Create Your Taste\" (CYT) platform uses kiosks where customers choose from a wide variety of options--from proteins to buns and toppings--to build a burger as they want it. With \"Signature Crafted Recipes\" customers choose one of four \"Flavors\" (topping combinations)  plus one of three bun options and a protein (beef, grilled chicken or Crispy buttermilk Chicken). The \"Signature\" platform was initially tested in 2015 under the name \"TasteCrafted.\"\n\n\"Signature Crafted Recipes'\" four \"Flavors\" offered in test are 'Pico Guacamole\" (pico de gallo, guacamole, buttermilk ranch, white Cheddar and leaf lettuce), \"Maple Bacon Dijon\" (maple-flavored bacon, Dijon mustard, caramelized onion, white Cheddar and lettuce), Deluxe (lettuce, tomato, onion and mayo) and \"Buffalo Bacon\" (blue cheese spread, buffalo sauce, applewood-smoked bacon, tomato and lettuce).\n\nIn San Diego and selected Pacific Northwest test markets, the \"Signature Crafted Recipes\" platform also has offered a \"Signature Sriracha\" combination (above) with sriracha-flavored Big Mac sauce, baby spinach, white Cheddar, baby Kale, crispy onions and choice of protein. BurgerBusiness.com reported the test in June. \nCYT originated in 2014 and was first widely implemented and refined in Australia. It arrived in China in 2015; Canada started rolling it out in September 2015 and it has been added across Europe we couldn't make it work, apparently.\nCYT was developed during the administration of former CEO Don Thompson. In a Jan. 23, 2015, Q4 earnings call with analysts very shortly before he was replaced by current CEO Steve Easterbrook, Thompson said McDonald's had \"plans to roll Create Your Taste across the majority of our restaurants by the end of this year.\" It didn't happen. \nThompson also said it \"has the potential to lift sales of core classics, by bringing more customers into our restaurants.\" Apparently that hasn't happened either.\nEasterbrook hosted a \"Turnaround Summit\" for franchisees in April 2015, presenting ideas that could help reverse the brand's sales slide in the U.S. CYT was among those concepts, but not all franchisees were impressed with its complexity or the cost to implement it. In a survey conducted by restaurant Mark Kalinowski, several voiced concerns. \"The ideas presented--such as Create Your Taste--do not fit our business model,\" said one.\nSaid anther operator, \"CYT will cost approximately $125,000 per restaurant. It sounds like, initially, sales with this new concept are very slow taking off.\" \nEasterbrook has touted CYT's success in Australia and elsewhere as examples of how the  \"Experience of the Future\" for McDonald's will evolve: more customization, more technology such as kiosk ordering and expanded table service.

Too sciencey?\u201d he tweeted.\u00a0\nThe comment prompted a long Twitter discussion, in which parents shared photos of their science-loving daughters and called for retailers to just #LetToysBeToys.\u00a0Peck, who has a 4-year-old daughter, also shared a photo of a John Lewis \u201cBoys Pirate Ship\u201d product listing, which he tweeted in 2013 with a similar message.\u00a0\n\u201cAs the father of a young daughter, I\u2019m constantly shocked at the messages we send to children from the earliest age about who they should be and how they should behave according to their gender,\u201d Peck told The Huffington Post.\n\u201cChildren learn everything they know from watching what adults do and say, and when we call girls bossy, say boys shouldn\u2019t cry, or talk about boys\u2019 jobs and girls\u2019 jobs, we limit their potential hugely,\u201d he added.\nSpeaking from his personal perspective as a parent, Peck noted,\u00a0\u201cI want my daughter to feel able to do what she wants to do \u2015 be a mother, a fire fighter or a scientist \u2015 based on her talents and ambitions, not what society thinks is appropriate for her to do. It\u2019s really not that radical, and it\u2019s sad that it still needs saying.\u201d\nWhile Peck acknowledged that major retailers like John Lewis have made great progress on this issue in recent years, he said it\u2019s still important for people to call out products that promote harmful gender stereotypes\u00a0when they see them.\u00a0\u00a0\nJohn Lewis representatives have taken note of Peck\u2019s tweet and maintain that it was simply a matter of erroneous labeling.\u00a0A spokesperson for the company told HuffPost UK:\nWhether or not the label was an error, Peck is still pleased that the tweet provoked an important discussion. \u201cIt\u2019s easy to use words without thinking about what message they send to our kids, so its great to break that down, even if just by the tiniest bit,\u201d he told HuffPost. \u201cI also hope retailers will realize there are lots of people out there who really care about this stuff and keep working to improve.\u201d\n#LetToysBeToys\n", "url": "http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/dad-calls-out-needlessly-gendered-label-on-space-themed-lunch-box_us_581b569ae4b0c43e6c1e7ce9", "tags": ["science"]},

The real crime was what Wal-Mart put her...", "title": "Wal-Mart's Astounding Shoplifting Trap", "text": "By Al Norman\nIt took a jury one minute to find 57-year-old Vicki Carll not guilty of shoplifting from Wal-Mart. The real crime was what Wal-Mart put her through by seeking prosecution when they knew she was innocent.\nAccording to court documents filed in Florida, Vicki Carll, a disabled mother, has retaliated for how Wal-Mart treated her by filing a lawsuit of her own against the retailer over the alleged shoplifting incident at a  Wal-Mart in Tampa two  years ago.  \nOn January 2, 2014, Carll went to Wal-Mart to buy dog food. After browsing the aisles, Carll went to the pet food aisle, put a large bag of dog food in her cart, and picked up a box of  flea medication to read the instructions. She noticed that this particular  box of flea medication had already been opened.  It appeared that the contents of the box were still inside and were undisturbed.\nCarll began walking on for a while with the flea medication in her hand, reading the instructions. She realized that this medication was for dogs much larger than hers, so she returned the box to a nearby shelf. Carll proceeded to the check-out stand to pay for her dog food. She was unaware that a Wal-Mart \"floor- walker\" had been following her from a distance. According to the lawsuit, the \"floor walker's job... is to look out for retail theft.\"  \nCarll's complaint says the Wal-Mart worker \"had an ulterior plan and motive for which Ms. Carll seemed to be the perfect victim.\" The complaint alleges that the Wal-Mart loss prevention worker had observed Carll \"pick up the box of flea and tick medication and watched from hiding as she returned it to the shelf.\"\nThe floor-walker \"secretly followed behind her and surreptitiously grabbed the box of flea and tick medication from the shelf where Ms. Carll had returned it.\" He then went to the main entrance/exit area of the store and positioned himself on a bench just inside the main doors and waited for Ms. Carll to approach, keeping the box of pet medication concealed from view.\nWhile Carll was standing in the check-out line, the floor-walker \"removed the individual doses from the medication box and laid them on the ground under the bench where he sat in wait for Ms. Carll.\" \"As would soon become clear,\" the worker's \"seemingly inexplicable behavior was actually part of an elaborate plan concocted...to frame an innocent shopper and allow him to make an arrest, or 'stop,' on his very first day on the job, thereby ingratiating himself  with his Wal-Mart employer.\" \n\nAs she passed by the bench, the floor-walker, \"leapt off his bench as soon as she passed and fell in directly behind her.\" He then \"physically accosted\" Carll on the sidewalk, and \"with his full force and strength, physically took hold of Ms. Carll and began dragging her by force back inside the store to a spot next to the bench.\"\nThe floor-walker was then joined by a second Wal-Mart employee who also \"physically lay hands\" on Vicki Carll, and dragged her back inside the store to the bench, and \"forcefully threw Ms. Carll to the ground.\" \"The force of being thrown to the ground caused Ms. Carll intense pain, as she had a pre-existing back injury from an automobile accident. The take-down...severely aggravated Ms. Carll's condition and caused her additional injuries.\"  \nThe floor-walker then \"reached under the bench and pretended to find the doses of pet medication scattered there beneath the bench. \"Feigning surprise,\" the floor-walker \"loudly - and falsely - proclaimed that Ms. Carll had attempted to steal the medicine by hiding it in her sleeve, and that she must have dropped it when she was forced to the ground.\" The Wal-Mart worker  \"falsely claimed that he had witnessed Ms. Carll take and conceal the pet medication while inside the store. He said that he had then 'sprung a trap' for her and had caught her in the act of trying to steal the pet medicine doses.\"\n \"Apparently unbeknownst\" to the floor-walker, however, \"Wal-Mart maintained security surveillance cameras in the area of the store entrance which recorded the events of that day.\"  The video footage shows the floor-walker himself removing the pet medication doses from its box as he sat on the bench waiting for Carll to check out. According to the lawsuit, the video shows the floor-walker placing the medication doses on the ground underneath the bench. \nWithin an hour after the \"forced takedown and false arrest scheme,\" Wal-Mart had available to it the video surveillance footage that \"conclusively demonstrated Ms. Carll's innocence and the attempted frame-up by its employee.\" The complaint charges that Wal-Mart knew \"without question\" that Carll was innocent, that their own employee \"had falsely accused her and planted false evidence to support the false accusations.\" \nYet Wal-Mart \"took the almost incomprehensible step of initiating criminal charges and  proceedings against Ms. Carll.\" The lawsuit says that Wal-Mart \"intentionally and recklessly forced Ms. Carll to undergo the fear and humiliation of having to face criminal charges and forced her to live for a substantial time with the fear of being wrongfully convicted of a charge on which she was innocent.\" Carll \"had to endure the humiliation of being processed into the criminal justice system all the way through a jury trial,\" \nBut soon the humiliation flipped. According to Channel 10 News/Tampa, a Hillsborough County jury \"found Carll not guilty in less than a minute.\" Carll's attorney told Channel 10, \"I've never seen a case I can think about where the bad guy -- in this case the Wal-Mart employee -- was actually caught on video planting the evidence.\"\nThe complaint notes that Wal-Mart \"allowed its employees to take the witness stand under oath and falsely accuse Ms. Carll of an act of theft which Wal-Mart knew she had not committed.\" The litigation says Wal-Mart \"apparently decided to carry the charade of criminal proceedings to their ultimate conclusion by jury trial just to try to protect itself from civil liability by not admitting the outrageous wrongdoing of its own employees.\"\nCarll's attorney says \"she has been placed on anti-anxiety medications which she never before had to take and suffers from a fear of being in public and in social situations...Ms. Carll no longer shops at public retail stores unless absolutely necessary and makes her purchases on line whenever possible.\" \nOn Halloween, Carll's attorney filed a petition in the Thirteenth Circuit for Hillsborough County, Florida, seeking a jury trial and damages against defendants Wal-Mart and its two employees. One of the jurors that sat on the panel during Wal-Mart's original prosecution  against Carll told Channel 10 News he \"couldn't believe the state wasted time and money with this case.\"\nAfter the jury acquitted Carll, Wal-Mart issued a statement which began: \"This was an unfortunate event in a number of ways.\" But the retailer expressed no remorse and accepted no blame for what happened to Vicki Carll.\nThis elaborate entrapment and prosecution was over a bottle of flea medication worth $29, proving once again that Wal-Mart knows the price of everything -- but  the value of nothing.\nAl Norman is the founder of Sprawl-Busters.
