{"abstract": "THE England rugby ace tells LUCY BENYON how his family\u2019s terrifying experience with meningitis has spurred him to back a campaign to raise awareness of a rare form of the disease.", "text": "Watching his two little boys running red-faced around the garden, laughing as they throw leaves at each other, former England rugby captain Matt Dawson is the picture of fatherly pride. He clearly adores being a dad but after almost losing his younger son, Sami, to a rare strain of meningitis earlier this year, his happy family life is something he certainly doesn\u2019t take for granted.\nSami suddenly fell ill in February, only weeks after celebrating his second birthday.\nHe spent a fortnight fighting for his life in intensive care at Great Ormond Street Hospital after contracting Men W, a strain of meningitis most commonly associated with young people, mainly students. Luckily, Sami now appears to have made a full recovery but his son\u2019s illness is something Matt, 44, will never forget.\nMeningitis is the inflammation of the lining of the brain and the spinal cord and septicaemia is the blood poisoning form of the illness. According to the Meningitis Research Foundation, 3,200 cases of meningitis and septicaemia occur in the UK each year.\nA tenth of these turn out to be fatal and a quarter of all survivors are left with life-altering repercussions. Having witnessed how devastating the illness can be first hand, former scrum-half Matt is now desperate to raise public awareness of meningitis and together with pharmaceutical firm GlaxoSmithKline, has launched Tackle Meningitis, a campaign that is backed by the Meningitis Research Foundation and Meningitis Now.\nIts aims are twofold: to make people more familiar with the early symptoms of meningitis and aware that there are different strains of the disease.\n\u201cI wish I had known more about meningitis and what to look out for before Sami got ill,\u201d admits Matt, who also has a four-year-old son, Alex, with his wife Carolin, 31, a former model.\n\u201cPeople tend to think of the \u2018tumbler test\u2019 but before a rash there are other less well-known symptoms such as fever, vomiting, headache, limb pain, pale skin, cold hands and feet, quick breathing, neck stiffness and aversion to light.\u201d\nLooking back, Matt can see that Sami had almost all of those early symptoms. Yet when he woke up hot and uncharacteristically grumpy on that February morning, he and Carolin assumed their son had a bad cold or virus and gave him paracetamol.\nThroughout the course of the day, Sami\u2019s symptoms became more worrying. He was sick, drowsy and had what appeared to be a small seizure, something he had experienced with a temperature in the past.\nBy mid-afternoon, he also had a very faint rash on his stomach. Concerned, Matt called his private doctor, who was unable to see Sami for a few hours and advised Matt to take him to A&E.\nBy the time he was examined at Chelsea & Westminster Hospital, only minutes after arriving, the very faint rash, which Matt and Carolin had assumed was a heat rash, had become something more obvious and within minutes Sami was being pumped full of antibiotics and put into an induced coma.\n\u201cWe were told he most probably had meningitis and we both felt complete disbelief,\u201d says Matt.\n\u201cWe just hadn\u2019t realised how ill he was.\u201d\nOver the next few hours, Sami was transferred to Great Ormond Street Hospital and with friends and family helping out with Alex, Matt and Carolin were able to stay by their desperately sick son\u2019s side.\n\u201cWhen we arrived at Great Ormond Street a doctor told me that the next 48 hours were crucial and I just kept thinking: \u2018Is our son going to die?\u2019\u201d says Matt.\n\u201cThe doctors couldn\u2019t give us any real hope and simply told us: \u2018It\u2019s up to Sami now\u2019.\u201d\nBy then the lesions covering Sami\u2019s body made it obvious he was suffering from meningitis and blood tests later revealed he had Men W. This strain is on the rise, from 22 cases in 2009 to more than 200 in the last 12 months, according to figures from the Meningitis Research Foundation.\nAs with many parents, Matt and Carolin had assumed their son was protected from the disease as he\u2019d had the Men C vaccination as a baby. However Sami had not had the Men B jab (which offers some protection against Men W) as it was not given to babies in the UK until this year.\n\u201cAll we could do was wait, which made me feel so helpless,\u201d recalls Matt, his voice trembling slightly.\n\u201cWe just stayed by Sami\u2019s side, reading to him in case he could hear us. It was almost impossible to process the fact that our little boy\u2019s life hung in the balance and there was nothing I could do.\u201d\nFortunately Sami rallied and five days into\u00a0the illness Matt and Carolin were told he had turned a corner. The next day he was brought out of his coma and although very weak, he still managed to speak.\n\u201cIt was amazing,\u201d says Matt.\n\u201cWe were so incredibly lucky.\u201d\nAfter a further eight days in hospital, Sami was allowed home to recover and luckily hasn\u2019t been left with any side-effects. Since Sami\u2019s illness the whole family has been vaccinated against Men W.\nLast year a programme began to immunise teenagers aged between 14 and 18 with the Men ACWY vaccine. Young people under the age of 25, particularly students who haven\u2019t been vaccinated, are being encouraged to visit their GP or health centre for a free jab.\nA particularly aggressive strain of Men W, ST-11, is now causing cases of severe illness in all age groups in the UK and Europe. Affecting young adults the most, it is relatively uncommon in children as young as Sami. Yet as Matt knows only too well, nobody is really immune.\n\u201cMeningitis can happen to anyone,\u201d he says.\n\u201cI want people, and in particular young people, to be aware of the risks and to get immunised so we can give everyone the best chance against this dreadful disease.\u201d\n", "tags": ["lifestyle"], "url": "http://www.express.co.uk/life-style/life/729482/Rugby-Matt-Dawson-son-meningitis-charity-disease-awareness", "title": "Rugby ace Matt Dawson: I kept thinking our son was going to die"},
{"abstract": "JAMES WALKER, the consumer champion helping you resolve your consumer complaints, talks about telecoms complaints. ", "text": "Telecoms - do fewer complaints mean there's less to complain about?\u00a0\nIf there's one huge monthly outlay for many of us, it's paying for our TV services, landline phones and mobiles and broadband internet.\u00a0\nAll of these forms of communication are so crucial to the way we live our daily lives but they don't come cheap. They probably represent one of the largest chunks of monthly expenditure after our mortgage/rent and electricity/gas bills.\u00a0\nAnd given how much money we are paying for all of these packages, we shouldn't ever have to put up with problems. Resolver.co.uk users regularly get in touch to tell me about issues they are suffering with bad connections, poor customer service or their bills and packages going up in price.\u00a0\nOn the flip side there was actually a recent report from UK communications regulator Ofcom that showed a decline in the number of complaints made between April and June 2016 about these sort of providers.\u00a0\nBut to me that doesn't necessarily mean there is less to complain about. It may simply mean people aren't taking the time to complain, or are finding it hard to do so.\u00a0\nI know from experience - ever since we launched Resolver to make complaining easier - that so many people are put off raising issues because they see it as wasting time, impossible to get satisfaction from big businesses and also complicated to do.\u00a0\nAnd if anyone has ever waited on hold for ages or searched fruitlessly for the right email address to contact, you'll know the frustrations that can be involved. That's exactly why we exist, to get around those problems and make life simpler for everyone with an issue to raise.\u00a0\nOur free and independent template emails do just that and we can see the benefit clearly during 2016 so far. Users of Resolver.co.uk have taken the time to raise 2,600+ issues about TV providers, 2,500+ relating to landline phones, 18,000+ about mobile networks and 14,000+ regarding internet and broadband.\u00a0\nI always remind people that they have far more power than they assume. Big companies can only continue to be big companies if they have customers.. And no-one wants to lose customers due to bad service.\u00a0\nAnd often the only time they hear or know about bad service is when people like you get in touch with them to tell them about it.\u00a0\nSo what can you do to help with that? Here's some of my key tips for dealing with communications providers when you have a problem.\nMake it clear you may leave\u00a0\nDon't wait until the last minute. Know when your contract is up - put it in a diary or calendar - and tell your provider you are thinking of leaving them. They won't want to hear that. But you have no reason to stay loyal unless they are loyal to you back with a decent deal renewal.\nUsually they will offer you some good reasons to stay a customer, especially if you provide quotes from competitors and ask them to match the prices. However, and this is key, you don't have to accept their first offer. Even if they say it is the best possible price they can give you, it isn't always. Always keep negotiating until YOU are happy.\u00a0\nCompare all the alternatives\u00a0\nEvery month, Resolver.co.uk publishes a list of the top companies for customer service to help people like you know which are the best businesses to buy from. This allows you to go off, search out other deals and decide which is right for you based on\u00a0\nprice, reviews, customer feedback and our own independent chart. There's so much competition out there today that you can sometimes find the same deal, or nearly as good, by switching provider.\nAnd that's never as much hassle these days as you believe it to be. Besides, if you can get more for your money as a 'new' customer elsewhere, then it makes total sense even if it means a few days of disruption and some phone calls and forms. That's the only way bad businesses begin to shape up, when they realise they are losing custom.\u00a0\nContact Customer Retention\u00a0\nIn every company of all shapes and sizes, there's a group of people whose one and only job is to keep you happy and keep you as a customer. Don't be afraid to speak to them and move on from Customer Services if the employee there is not giving you what you want.\nYou might even find that they will actually offer you a much better deal than the one already offered by their own colleague in another department. They have far more room to move and ultimately they do not want to lose you. Just be polite and friendly and don't demand. Simply ask for what you want and feel is the best deal and base it on quotes elsewhere or changes in your own circumstances.\u00a0\nKnow your important dates\u00a0\nAlways be careful to never to let a contract 'roll over' into a new period. Sometimes this will mean any special offers you've previously had given to you will be taken off your bill and you'll find you're paying far more with little or no way to get out of the new contract.\nAlways start way ahead of time to be able to negotiate new deals and pricing. You'd be surprised how many people forget this and not all companies will inform you of your impending contract end date or that it is time to renew. Many contracts are continuous and simply roll over unless you make the effort and act to cancel them.\nSo be careful and read all the terms and conditions carefully and check through any letters received in the post or emails arriving in your inbox that you may think are circulars or spam but are actually far more important.\u00a0\nFinally remember this: never be afraid to tell a company if you are not experiencing good enough service or the price is not right for you. You are the customer and you deserve the best. Now go out and get what you're entitled to and that's simply the best deal possible for you personally.\u00a0\n\n", "tags": ["lifestyle"], "url": "http://www.express.co.uk/life-style/life/729570/James-Walker-consumer-champion-telecom-complaints", "title": "James Walker: How to make a complaint to telecoms AND get the best result "},

But she made a dismissive hand gesture and insisted that I call her \u201cCallie\u201d.\u00a0\n\u201cOnly if you call me \u2018Beachie\u2019,\u201d I replied, so with that settled, the interview began.\n\u201cPerhaps,\u201d I suggested, \u201cyou could start by giving a brief account of the history and duties of Royal Blue Permanent.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019d be delighted to,\u201d she said. \u201cThe post was created by Queen Elizabeth in 1573 after she is said to have thrown a regal tantrum after losing her quill pen.

The Royal Stationery Cupboard was then constructed and the post of Keeper of the Cupboard created.\n\u201cOriginally the duties of that post mainly comprised the plucking, selection and sharpening of goose quills and the topping up of ink wells but later responsibilities were added as further stationery items became available.\u201d\n\u201cSo where does the post of Royal Blue Permanent come in?\u201d I asked.\u00a0\n\u201cI was coming to that,\u201d she said. \u201cBy 1786, the activities of the Keeper of the Stationery Cupboard had become so numerous that it became necessary to set up Her Majesty\u2019s Stationery Office to handle its commercial side. To appease the Keeper of the Cupboard, the additional role of Royal Blue Permanent was added to his responsibilities, particularly with regard to parliamentary matters.\u201d\n\u201cParliamentary matters?\u201d I queried.\n\u201cYes,\u201d she confirmed. \u201cThese are manifold, though two of them are particularly essential to preserve the smooth running of the state. First, the Cupboard is where the portfolio that the Minister Without Portfolio doesn\u2019t have is kept securely, and secondly, it houses the Grey Stick which is only ever seen at the royal opening of Parliament where it is carried by Grey Stick in Waiting in case Black Rod forgets to bring his Black Rod.\u201d\n\u201cThese are vital responsibilities,\u201d I agreed, \u201cso why has your role been kept so secret until now?\u201d\n\u201cThe very existence of the Cupboard became a state secret in 1649 when if was briefly used to store the head of the recently executed Charles I while Cromwell decided what to do with it. Shortly after that however the Great Cupboard Feud broke out between Royal Blue Permanent and the Master of Furnishings, Fixtures and Fittings.\u201d\n\nTo be continued tomorrow.\n", "tags": ["opinion"], "url": "http://www.express.co.uk/comment/beachcomber/729730/Beachcomber-99-years-old-still-stationary-cupboard", "title": "Beachcomber: 99 years old and STILL as stationary as a cupboard..."},

Anyone who thinks life on the old-age pension is a luxury holiday can\u2019t have shopped for groceries or paid a gas bill within the past few decades.\nThe state pension is not a benefit. In most cases it is a hard-earned right for a lifetime of work and tax.\nThe same Labour-led committee also wants winter fuel allowances and free travel passes to be means-tested, neglecting the fact that 40 or 50 years of PAYE more than pays for such scraps.\nBritain has one of the poorest pension systems in the civilised world and now that repeated tax attacks have virtually wiped out the private pension system the state handout is more important than ever.\nThe over-60s also vote. Or do politicians think we should lose that right too?\n--------------------------\nOn my usual Sunday morning walk to the park I had to negotiate a trail of broken glass and rubbish.\nThen it dawned on me that the big firework display had happened the night before, supposedly a family occasion but from the debris a battle between armies of yobs.\nThe same goes for New Year\u2019s Eve and I will never forget the carnage left after the Millennium celebrations.\nThese occasions have become an excuse for disgusting behaviour and violence. A crying shame.\n--------------------------\nSo-called smart motorways with variable speed limits and average speed checks have resulted in a massive increase in fines.\nAt the same time traffic is slowing down, reaching just 13.7mph on London\u2019s M25 at peak times. Cycling would be quicker.\nLocal authorities are also planning draconian penalties on diesel-powered vehicles and company car drivers are facing a huge increase in tax.\nCameras spy on us.

An accelerometer built into each AirPod detects when you\u2019re speaking, enabling the microphones to focus on the sound of your voice, filtering out external noise.\nBecause these new headphones do not include any wires \u2013 they need a battery and, with the ultra-efficient Apple W1 chip powering them, they pack some five hours of battery life for audio playback.\nApple AirPod headphones ship with a companion charging case, that lets you top-up the wireless headphones with an additional 24 hours of battery life.\nIf you fancy a pair they will set you back \u00a3159, which includes the AirPods and charging case.\n\u00a0has got our hands on an early pre-production pair of AirPods from Apple, and have been using them regularly for the past few weeks.\nAirPods are incredibly impressive.\nThe Apple wireless headphones are comfortable to wear, easy to set-up and sound good.\nFor such a diddy device the battery life is also reasonably good and the charging case will give them a boost when they run low.\nOn the negative side, not everyone is going to like the design as, until people get use to them, they do look a bit odd.\nAnd we have noticed some slight interference with the sound at busy train stations (we are however testing an early review pair and not a finished product).\nAt \u00a3159 the AirPods aren't cheap but, we've got a feeling when they do finally launch, they are going to be hugely popular.\u00a0\n", "tags": ["tech"], "url": "http://www.express.co.uk/life-style/science-technology/728860/AirPods-UK-Release-Date-Update-Apple-Headphones", "title": "AirPods Release Date - This new update is NOT good news for Apple fans "},

It\u2019s core to the identity and the experience you get. But iOS doesn\u2019t have a menu at the top. It never will.\n\"The thought of pointing at a menu at the top of an iPhone feels wrong.\n\"If you made the Mac a touchscreen you\u2019d have to figure out how to make it a good experience with your finger on a touchscreen.\n\"Trust me, we\u2019ve looked at that \u2014 it\u2019s a bad experience. It\u2019s not as good or as intuitive as with a mouse and trackpad.\"\nAlthough many have been critical that Apple hasn't included a touchscreen the tech firm may have a point.\nMicrosoft unveiled its Surface Book laptop in the UK earlier this year which features a detachable touchscreen.\nIt's clever stuff, but having tested this ultimate portable Windows PC earlier this year, Express.co.uk soon became hugely frustrated with the experience.\nAlong with the bizarre gap that's created between the keyboard and the display.\nThere\u2019s also the matter of the annoying bounce whenever you use the Surface Book\u2019s touchscreen in laptop mode.\nWith a touch display you're also left with a screen covered in fingerprints.\nApple's products have always been about the user experience and producing the Touch Bar makes the new MacBook more interactive without compromising the design.\nTaking about this new technology, Schiller revealed: \"It\u2019s part of our thinking about where to take the notebook next.\n\"Others are trying to turn the notebook into the tablet. The new MacBook Pro is a product that celebrates that it is a notebook, this shape that has been with us for the last 25 years is probably going to be with us for another 25 years because there\u2019s something eternal about the basic notebook form factor.\n\"The team came up with this idea that you can create a multi-touch surface that\u2019s coplanar with the keyboard and the trackpad but brings a whole new experience into it, one that\u2019s more interactive, with multi-touch.\"\nExpress.co.uk has had an exclusive first-look at the new Touch Bar and our initial impressions are good.\nUsing it is incredibly intuitive and it makes tasks such as editing photos, replying to messages and even taking a screen shot a lot quicker, easier and far more fun.\nThe Bar also includes Touch ID which unlocks the MacBook with your fingerprint and allows you to securely pay for goods online.\nWe hope to bring you a full review of the MacBook Pro 2016 with Touch Bar soon.\n", "tags": ["tech"], "url": "http://www.express.co.uk/life-style/science-technology/728790/New-Macbook-Pro-2016-Apple-Microsoft-laptop-touch-screen", "title": "New Macbook Pro 2016: Apple hasn't made the same mistake as Microsoft - here's why"},

The South Korean firm says that\u2019s by design, since its research shows 80 per cent of smartwatch owners are men.\u00a0\nBut that trend quickly becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy when the only accomplished smartwatches on the market are swollen wrist-behemoths, like the Gear S3 Frontier.\u00a0\nAnd even amongst the target audience, the chunky Gear S3 series will only appeal to those looking for a large watch.\nUnlike rival smartwatch ranges from Apple and Motorola, there is no choice of screen size with the Gear S3 Classic and Frontier.\u00a0\nThat didn\u2019t matter so much with the slight,\u00a0one-size-fits-all Gear S2, but it feels like an issue that will alienate more than a few buyers this time around.\nThe S3 Classic is the least appealing of the two, thanks to its plain silver face, which lacks the design flourishes seen on the Gear S3 Frontier.\nSamsung's wearable operating system, TizenOS, still performs admirably, and the spinning bezel is a brilliant way to navigate around the beautiful, simplistic operating system.\nHowever the\u00a0app ecosystem hasn\u2019t grown in any meaningful way since it launched alongside the Samsung Gear S2, which is disappointing.\n\u00a0will be spending some more time with the Gear S3, and will have a full in-depth review soon.\n", "tags": ["tech"], "url": "http://www.express.co.uk/life-style/science-technology/728722/Samsung-Gear-S3-UK-Price-Stock-More-Than-Apple-Watch", "title": "Samsung Gear S3 - The worst version of this smartwatch costs more than an Apple Watch "},
